              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  Later this month we'll mark National Police Remembrance Day. The date of 29 September is derived from the feast day of St Michael, the patron saint of police. This year marks the 36th National Police Remembrance Day, an important day where we pay tribute to the courageous officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. In remembering this day, I pay particular respect to the members of this House who have dedicated part of their professional lives to taking that risk, the members for Richmond, Tangney, Wide Bay and Cowper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every loss of life is a tragedy; every loss of life gets felt by the community. But there's an even greater chasm left when we know that the person we've lost had chosen to put themselves in harm's way to protect the rest of us. At these moments, the risk that every officer takes is realised in the most awful way. When this happens, the grieving is not limited to friends or family; it belongs to the entire nation. The unspeakable violence which was committed against an officer in Tasmania, Constable Keith Anthony Smith, and most recently against officers in Victoria, Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, has shaken us as a nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day our police put themselves in the service of the community. They put themselves on the line. That's a spirit of courage and selflessness that is the mark of every man and woman from the moment they make the choice to enlist. And, as we keep being reminded, there will be times when that spirit is called on to a degree that is nothing short of extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last night I had the honour of presenting the National Police Bravery Award to two Australian Federal Police officers and three members of the NSW Police Force. Sergeant Aaron Cox and Inspector Peter Murphy of the Australian Federal Police were recognised for their incredible acts of bravery in response to a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Port Vila while stationed in Vanuatu. Both Sergeant Cox and Inspector Murphy repeatedly entered a collapsed building in which many people were trapped. They made the conscious decision to stay and treat casualties, apply makeshift medical aid and evacuate victims, all while they believed a tsunami was imminent. Their selflessness, courage and leadership under these extreme conditions saved lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sergeant Daniel Cooper, Senior Constable Adam Davis and Senior Constable Joshua Naughtin of the New South Wales Police Force were also recognised for their bravery in response to the Manning River in Taree in May of this year. These three officers rescued 38 people across multiple locations, and these rescues were nothing short of extraordinary. One man was rescued by Sergeant Cooper and Senior Constable Davis after spending four hours in neck-deep water. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At another location, a family of five was rescued from the second storey of their home amid live powerlines in the floodwaters. Perhaps the most extraordinary of them all, in conditions so extreme that the State Emergency Service and PolAir were not able to assist, Senior Constables Davis and Naughtin launched their own flood rescue boat. They proceeded to rescue five people from two locations, including three elderly residents at the second location, one of whom was trapped in a roof cavity. Senior Constables Davis and Naughtin brought these five residents to safety in near darkness and worsening weather, against the current of the floodwater. They were presented with their National Police Bravery Awards in recognition of acting well beyond their duty by knowingly entering life-threatening conditions to save others and by conducting rescues when no other agency could. They undoubtedly saved lives and demonstrated exceptional bravery and commitment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This tenacity and commitment of police force members and law enforcement partners allows our policing community to continue to achieve substantial operational results, maximising their impact on the criminal environment. Our law enforcers work tirelessly in challenging situations to ensure the safety and protection of Australians and our way of life. Their work goes way beyond the ordinary concepts that we might have—which is still extraordinary work—of policing and community policing that, as local members, we deal with every day. There are also police officers every day having to dedicate their work to look at some of the most horrific images that we could imagine. There are officers who are playing roles around the Pacific and around the world in helping to improve the police capacity of other police forces. There are police officers engaged in extraordinary work getting to the bottom of and working out how to deal with transnational, serious and organised crime. But the common thread through all of this is that they put themselves at risk to keep us safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 September, we pause to acknowledge those who have committed their lives to the service of our community and who died trying to make our country a safer place for all Australians and, as a parliament, we honour them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:07</span>):  I join with the Minister for Home Affairs in making a statement on National Police Remembrance Day. On 29 September every year, we pause to honour the service and sacrifice of our police officers who paid the ultimate price and lost their lives in the line of duty. We take this opportunity to honour the men and women who dutifully serve each and every day, willingly putting themselves in harm's way to protect their fellow Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 June this year, Constable Keith Smith was tragically shot and killed on duty in Tasmania. Just last week, Australians were horrified when Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart were shot and killed in the line of duty in Porepunkah in Victoria. Our deepest condolences go to their loved ones and colleagues, who have been devastated by this loss. We also remember and honour the detective who was injured and those police officers working tirelessly in the cold, rugged Victorian countryside to bring the killer to justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These tragic events are a sombre reminder of the dangers police face every day and the incredible courage it takes to serve our communities and country with that uncertainty. Every year, on 29 September, we pay tribute to those officers who gave their lives while serving and protecting the Australian people—men and women who lost their lives for the betterment of ours. Every year, on 29 September, we also recommit to providing solace and support to the partners, children, families and colleagues of our fallen officers who now carry their memory but also the scars of their loss. We also encourage Australians to pause and reflect on the extraordinary service our police give to our communities and country. I join the minister in acknowledging those members in this House who served in uniform as police officers prior to coming to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, our police serve on the front lines, often in dangerous and difficult circumstances, sometimes at great personal cost and, all too often, unrecognised for their sacrifices. On behalf of the coalition and this parliament, I pay the deepest respect to our fallen officers. We thank all those who continue to serve. Their sacrifice and their service embody the great tradition of ordered liberty under law that makes our nation safe and free.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:10</span>):  People are our most important Australian defence capability. The resilience, dedication and professionalism of the defence and veteran community underpin our national security. We want Australians to be attracted to serving our nation in our Australian Defence Force and confident that they and their families will be well supported by their leaders, their mates and the broader defence organisation. In addition, they should be safe in the knowledge that, whatever may befall them in service, they and their families will be properly looked after and their service will be acknowledged by a grateful nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, when a person joins the Defence Force, their family makes sacrifices alongside them. It's important that families are looked after in all stages of their defence journey. It is our nation's duty to empower and support the mental health and wellbeing of our defence and veteran community. There is an expectation that they will be looked after. For too long, this was not the reality. It was the families of our defence personnel and veterans who have taken their own lives—people like Julie-Ann Finney, who campaigned in honour of her son, David, and is here today, and Senator Lambie, who joins us on the floor of the House—who worked with us to secure the establishment of a Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission heard from thousands of current and former serving defence members and families, particularly the families of those who are no longer here to speak for themselves. We heard of systems that were, frankly, broken; of culture that was toxic; and that simply not enough was being done to support our Aussie personnel in and following service. We've heard those calls, and we've been acting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission released an interim report in 2022 containing the recommendations they deemed the most urgent. We took action on all of them—actions like clearing the unallocated compensation claims backlog, the 41,000 cases that had been sitting unactioned; and ensuring that new claims are now being looked at by someone in the Department of Veterans' Affairs within 14 days of being submitted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good progress is being made on speeding up the system. New liability claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the MRCA, are being progressed in around 100 days. There is still more to do. We know there are still complex claims working through the system, and it is still taking too long to get through compensation claims. The positive changes have also seen a significant increase in claims being made to DVA and an increase in the complexity of those claims. All of this has reinforced the need to simplify and harmonise the veteran compensation system and the disaster of the current tri-act structure that causes confusion and frustration, which the royal commission found was a contributor to suicidality in our veteran community. We listened to stakeholders and engaged with the veteran and serving communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After hundreds of discussions and multiple adjustments, we were able to pass the VETS act, the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Act, in February of this year. That means that, from the middle of 2026, all veterans' claims will be assessed for compensation and rehabilitation under one single piece of legislation that will be simpler to use and faster to process. This is the most significant reform in a century to how we support veterans and means we'll be able to better provide the services and supports the veteran community needs when they need them. In response to recommendations 9 to 13 of the interim report, DVA and Defence have both worked to improve access to information for veterans and their families, simplifying the application process and making sure staff receive trauma informed training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September last year, the royal commission released its final report. It is harrowing reading—seven volumes and 122 recommendations. We were tasked with effecting a once-in-a-generation opportunity for cultural change and reform. By December our government had responded. We agreed or agreed in principle to 104 recommendations and noted 17 for further work. Work has been undertaken at pace in the nine months since, even with the federal election in the middle. This is not another report destined to live on the shelves; this is a living, breathing to-do list for government to do better. Those who have seen action, as well as those who haven't, deserve action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2024, we established the Royal Commission Implementation Taskforce within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to oversee the development of comprehensive and considered advice on a whole-of-government approach to implementing the government response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. We also funded DVA to undertake important consultations and co-design work on an ex-service organisation peak body and the establishment of a new wellbeing agency within DVA. By February this year we had legislated a new oversight body, the Defence and Veterans' Service Commission, which the royal commission deemed to be the most important recommendation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As at the beginning of August, nine recommendations had been fully implemented and a further 110 were underway, including a number that had only been noted. A significant number of recommendations are to be completed by the end of this year, one year from the government's formal response to the final report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission Implementation Taskforce has identified four broad areas for priority action: wellbeing, addressing military sexual conduct, the military justice system and the establishment of the Defence and Veterans' Service Commission. The establishment of a new oversight entity with a dedicated and sustained focus on suicide prevention was deemed by the royal commission to be the most significant action the Australian government could take to address defence and veteran suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence and Veterans' Service Commission is a new statutory entity that will be up and running by the end of September. It is set to provide independent oversight and evidence based advice to drive system reform to improve suicide prevention and wellbeing outcomes for the defence and veteran community. The Albanese government allocated $5 million to get the Defence and Veterans' Service Commission established. Today I can also announce that the commission will receive significant operational funding of $44.5 million over four years. We’re currently recruiting for the inaugural statutory Defence and Veterans' Service Commissioner through a merit based recruitment process. The commission will perform their functions independently of government, overseeing reform across the defence and veteran ecosystem. The Albanese government has empowered the commissioner with significant independent investigative powers into veteran support and progress on implementation of the royal commission's recommendations. This appointment will drive systemic change and champion the wellbeing of serving and ex-serving ADF members across government and the ex-service community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the recent Senate inquiry report into the legislative basis for the commission and thank the senators for their work and those that gave evidence. It has always been the government's view that the commission would be best provided for in its own standalone legislation, something that was not procedurally possible for us to do at the beginning of this year. We will do this. The commissioner will be appointed by the Governor-General, to provide greater independence, and we will ensure there is appropriate inclusion of defence and veteran families in its functions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission identified the need to have a more holistic approach to wellbeing when supporting defence personnel, veterans and families. Today I'm pleased to share with you the joint Defence and Veteran Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy. The Department of Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence have been working together and consulting since 2023 to develop the Defence and Veteran Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2025-30, together with the mental health and wellbeing action plan and the suicide prevention action plan. The strategy complements the Defence and Veteran Family Wellbeing Strategy 2025-30 and the Veteran Transition Strategy. These are all key foundational documents for the new wellbeing agency. In addition to early intervention and comprehensive care, it prioritises wellbeing from the day a person signs up for our ADF until well after they hang up their uniform for the last time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This strategy unites the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in their resolve to foster a culture of proactive wellbeing and mental health care, recognising that wellbeing exists in a continuum and cannot be segmented into service versus post-service life. This joint approach to improve mental health and wellbeing outcomes for the defence and veteran community will also begin to address recommendation 78 of the royal commission final report, relating to moral injury, noting there are broader efforts in partnership with other Five Eyes nations to research, minimise and prevent moral injury. Further, the strategy underpins the activities in the Australian government response to the royal commission final report. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely thank all of those current and former serving personnel, families and experts who have provided input to help shape the vision and goals of this strategy to improve the mental health and wellbeing of the defence and veteran community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission laid bare the sad and disturbing failures in the treatment of women—failures across the defence and veteran systems that reflect systemic and enduring problems that need to be acknowledged with honesty, addressed with urgency and never repeated. The Albanese government is committed to addressing these failures through the development of the women's veterans strategy, a comprehensive plan to ensure both current and former serving personnel are valued and properly supported at every stage of their service and transition to civilian life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This strategy will address either directly or indirectly 52 royal commission recommendations and is being shaped by the voices of women who have served. The strategy will address core areas such as health care, mental health, financial security, housing and family support, all through a gender informed lens. This is about more than policy reform; it's about fairness. It's about ensuring that every person who puts on the uniform, regardless of gender, is backed by a system that truly sees and supports them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide recommended the establishment of a new agency to focus on veterans' wellbeing and to support ADF members' transition to civilian life and their ongoing wellbeing. This is to make sure that veterans who are transitioning and their families don't fall through the gaps that can so easily emerge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government provided $4.5 million to DVA to commence a co-design and consultation process with the veteran community on both the wellbeing agency and an ex-service organisation peak body. A national roadshow has been held throughout this year, with over 44 co-design discovery workshops across 15 locations around Australia and online, working with more than 600 people. These sessions provided an opportunity for veterans, families, service providers and Defence to help shape what the new agency should do and how it should do it. Work is now occurring to finalise the wellbeing agency operating model, including its structure, functions and areas of responsibility, with a view to commencement mid next year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consultations have also been underway regarding the establishment of an ex-service organisation peak body, as recommended by the royal commission. It is vital that this peak body is developed and owned by the veteran community to ensure that it achieves the royal commission's vision. The government supports this initiative and is up for the challenge but can only realise it if the ex-service organisation sector itself grasps the opportunity. I encourage ex-service organisations of all sizes, locations and focus to share your feedback on a peak body. It is only with your collaboration, engagement and support that this recommendation can be realised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continued improvement of veterans' wellbeing also requires coordinated and ongoing research across a range of fields by Defence and DVA. This was recognised by the royal commission in a number of its recommendations. In particular and understandably, there is significant interest in the royal commission's recommendations related to brain injury. The Department of Defence is working on a range of preventive measures to minimise exposure to activities with a link to causing brain injury. Additionally, Defence is working with the Department of Veterans' Affairs on the establishment of a comprehensive brain injury program to improve prevention, early detection and treatment pathways for current and former ADF members with neurocognitive issues. They will work together with other partner nations' defence forces to benefit from their research as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to announce that DVA and Phoenix Australia have entered a strategic partnership to deliver a new model for research and evaluation in DVA. The model is called the Veteran and Family—Learning and Innovation Network of Knowledge (VF-LINK) and represents an investment of around $25 million over five years. Phoenix Australia will lead a consortium that brings together expert researchers and research translators from across Australia, to undertake work relating to numerous recommendations relating to research and evaluation. This work is being prioritised so we can improve how we can better protect people from injury in service, and support them following service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Defence there has been significant progress in how mental health is supported, how mental health issues and concerns about suicidality are identified and the training provided to personnel in this space. There's been huge take-up of training—some 67,300 defence personnel completed the Defence Suicide Awareness training between 1 January 2025 and 30 June this year. Programs are being piloted across ADF training establishments, including at the Australian Defence Force Academy, to better support veteran mental health, resilience and leadership development. This includes initiatives focused on early access to mental health services, peer mentoring and wellbeing resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's final report also contained a number of significant recommendations relating to Defence's response to sexual violence. Defence is taking decisive and immediate action to strengthen the way we respond to sexual violence within the Australian Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 15 has been implemented through an updated central policy on sexual misconduct, which now provides clearer, more consistent guidance for commanders and managers. It outlines when to engage the Joint Military Police Unit and how to determine whether conduct may constitute a criminal offence, and introduces structured return-to-work protocols for those impacted by misconduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the military justice system serves a distinct function, let me be clear: ADF personnel, like all Australians, are also subject to Australian civilian law—and our policies must reflect that accountability. To improve clarity and alignment with civilian legal standards, Defence is reviewing and updating key frameworks—including the Defence Complaints and Alternative Resolutions Manual—to ensure that definitions of sexual offences and reporting pathways are clearly articulated and in line with equivalent civilian provisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, ADF prosecution counsel are now required to invite victim impact statements to be considered by a service tribunal during sentencing—aligning military practice with longstanding procedures in the civilian courts. This change will soon be reinforced through legislative reform as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, in November 2024, the Chief of the Defence Force issued a directive relating to recommendations 18 to 21 from the royal commission for the need to consider suspension from duty and involuntary separation of members alleged to have engaged in serious misconduct, including sexual offences, sexual harassment, intimate image abuse and stalking. In response to recommendation 22, Defence has now completed work to support the implementation of a presumption of discharge in circumstances where ADF members are convicted of sexual and related offences. This measure will be in place before the end of the year and supported by further legislative change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms represent a critical shift. They send a clear message: sexual misconduct has no place in our Defence Force. We are building a culture that does not tolerate abuse, that acts decisively when harm occurs, and that places the safety and dignity of all members—especially those who have suffered in silence for too long—at the centre of our actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission identified the need for independence in both research on the prevalence of military sexual violence among current and former serving ADF members and the establishment of an independent inquiry into military sexual violence in the ADF. Given the focus on these recommendations being delivered independently of the ADF, the taskforce is leading on both. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission expressed concern about Defence's lack of reliable, integrated datasets for military sexual misconduct and its inability to quantify the prevalence or measure the effectiveness of interventions. Recommendation 14 sought research into the prevalence of military sexual trauma. Such research will inform recommendation 25, an independent inquiry into military sexual violence. That research will commence shortly. Work is also underway to develop the terms of reference for the inquiry, which will include consultation with current and former serving victims of sexual violence in the ADF. The inquiry will commence in 2026, and its report and recommendations to government will be made public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to military justice, in parallel to the royal commission, the 20-year review of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force, the IGADF, also occurred. The outcomes of that review were considered by the royal commission. The military justice system seeks to balance the need for military discipline with the protection of individual rights, fostering a fair and ordered working environment for ADF members that minimises adverse mental health impacts on those who engage with the system. In August 2024, the IGADF commenced an independent inquiry into potential weaponisation of the military administrative system, examining whether the system has been or could be misused in ways to cause harm to ADF members and recommending improvements in line with recommendation 30. In November 2024, the Chief of the Defence Force directed commanders and decision-makers to consider involuntary separation in cases of substantiated serious misconduct, including criminal conviction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2024, Defence established the Military Justice Assurance Branch to strengthen coordination of governance, assurance and policy functions within the military justice system. To improve the quality, consistency and communication of the inquiry process, Defence has created a dedicated joint workforce capability employment manager role to strengthen training and provide guidance for those conducting administrative inquiries. The office of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force continues to provide independent oversight through statutory functions such as reviews, inquiries, investigations and audits. The government is implementing recommendations to improve the independence of the IGADF, including conditions of appointment, strengthening the IGADF under separate legislation and enhancing independence in staff selection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consultation has occurred on the introduction of a mandatory obligation to consider mental health issues during involuntary separation processes. These changes will require amendments to the defence regulations, meaning implementation will be aligned with legislative change timelines. Defence is also assessing whether the support mechanisms available to members involved in the military justice processes are effective at meeting their needs and preventing harm. This is closely linked to broader work examining whether involvement in the military justice system may lead to adverse outcomes, per recommendation 33. Recommendation 23, to record convictions of civilian equivalent offences within the Australian Defence Force together with civilian criminal records, is also in train. Technical changes are required to ensure service conditions can be ingested by the National Police Reference System and the National Police Checking Support Service System and should be in place by the end of this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, of course, still a lot more work to come on implementing the recommendations of the royal commission. But, a year on from its final report, we are making good progress. However, the government has not limited itself to just the work coming from the royal commission. We set about improving supports for defence personnel, veterans and families before the work of the royal commission was complete. We're better supporting people in service, and we're seeing more people choose to stay in the ADF for longer as a result. We've also expanded our veterans and families hub network so people can access support close to home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A common theme throughout the royal commission was difficulties engaging with both the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in relation to information access. While the implementation of recommendations 9 to 13 of the interim report have significantly improved this, there is still more to do. On a very practical note, engaging with the Department of Veterans' Affairs is not as straightforward as it should be for the veteran community, and mechanisms like the DVA website were perhaps more of a barrier to providing useful information than actually being a useful tool. So I'm really pleased to share with you that today the new and improved DVA website has gone live. It is more user-friendly and includes, as a first of its kind for the federal government, an AI search tool that will actively answer questions from veterans about the supports and services they can and should receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's task for us as a government is no small feat, but we have no doubt that delivery of this will ensure the most comprehensive reforms to the systems, processes and culture to support defence personnel and veterans and families ever undertaken in Australia. Implementing these reforms from the royal commission is not a nice-to-have. It is vital in ensuring that defence personnel, veterans and families receive the care, services and supports they not only need but deserve. We will continue to do what's right—to take action on the royal commission as quickly as we can. It's the least we can do.</span>

                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  I want to begin by acknowledging the men and women in this place who have served in uniform and also those who may be listening to the broadcast at home and to say thank you for your service and thank you to your families who supported you in that service of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The oath of the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant ends with the words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For what they have done, this we will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a reminder to all of us in this place who haven't served in uniform. It's a reminder to a grateful nation that we have some significant obligations when it comes to our serving men and women and their families. We have to work tirelessly to make sure we are recruiting the right people to join Defence in the first place; that we are training them well; that we are giving them the capacity, the equipment and the support to serve well; and then that they're able to transition well and go on to live happy, healthy and successful lives in the civilian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge at the outset that I need to apologise to the TPI Federation. I was meant to be there this morning, at a wreath-laying service, and I will miss the opportunity to engage with them face-to-face. It is disappointing for those members on this side of the House to be given such late notice for statements in this manner. I was told last night, at 6.45 pm, that this statement would be made to the House. I had a prior commitment with the TPI Federation and couldn't keep that. I'm sorry I couldn't be there. It doesn't bode well for the bipartisanship which is needed in this portfolio. Sadly, it is somewhat typical of the arrogance and the hubris which has become contagious in this government. Not only has the Prime Minister stripped the crossbench of the additional staff needed to assess legislation; they've also cut the number of senior staff to the opposition, and it's a deliberate attempt to avoid accountability and scrutiny. Telling the opposition about such a major speech on such an important royal commission—a speech the minister is about to make in less than 15 hours—like this is somewhat typical of this government's approach. This is a speech that the minister had been working on for weeks, and the opposition was given less than 15 hours notice. They want bipartisan support, but they treat the opposition with contempt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sad to say we saw that in this place yesterday when we had legislation presented with no consultation—no consultation with the opposition whatsoever, no consultation with serving men and women, no consultation with veterans—seeking to impose a 20-year time limit on an independent statutory agency for review of Defence decisions on major medallic recognition. At a time when we're trying to engage and support our veteran community, it is extraordinary that the minister came in here and endeavoured to put lipstick on a pig and pretend this is a good reform when it actually disenfranchises our veterans and their families. Only an arrogant government would seek to disenfranchise veterans and their families as we deal with the recommendations of this royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government so filled with hubris they're ignoring the evidence of their own independent tribunal. When I say 'their own independent tribunal', this is a tribunal the Labor Party established in 2011. It was a good reform. It was part of the Gillard government's reform to provide a review capacity into Defence decisions so that veterans and advocates could seek to rectify previous, perhaps, injustices. Under that bipartisan reform, we were able to see, over the last decade, medallic recognition of the highest order—a Victoria Cross for Teddy Sheean, a Victoria Cross for Richard Norden. Commander Harry Smith, who led Delta Company, showed tireless dedication to ensure his men were properly recognised decades after that heroic action and received medallic recognition for their efforts at Long Tan. But under the reforms in the Defence Amendment (Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal) Bill 2025, which the government rammed through the House yesterday, none of them—Teddy Sheean, Richard Norden or Delta Company—would have the opportunity to have the decisions made by Defence reviewed, because the tribunal are going to have, thanks to yesterday's efforts by the Labor party, a 20-year time limit placed on their capacity to review Defence decisions. It is extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, on Anzac Day and at other major commemorative events, a proud tradition in Australia where we end with the words 'lest we forget'. They are three very powerful words. The sentence omitted before 'lest we forget' is, 'We will remember them.' But, under Labor's legislation rammed through the House yesterday, we will remember them sometimes! We will remember them if it fits in a 20-year time limit! 'We will remember them,' now has a use-by date thanks to this minister and thanks to this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want bipartisan support, but they rammed through legislation to effectively neuter an independent statutory agency at a time when we're trying to enfranchise our veterans through the recommendations of the royal commission. It was an appalling decision and misjudgement by the government and demonstrates that they're not really serious about achieving bipartisan support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister spoke on the legislation last Thursday, which surprised us all. We were quite stunned to see the legislation come into place. Then the bill was brought on yesterday. We know they won the election pretty convincingly, with about 93 or 94 seats, but the most extraordinary thing about yesterday was that only one of their members spoke. They were all missing in action. One member walked in to speak in defence of that legislation. We shouldn't be surprised to be treated with such arrogance and hubris by this government when we see examples like that, because this government has also been dragged, kicking and screaming, to deliver the fully independent Defence and Veterans' Services Commission, which is intended to win the trust of the veteran community and was actually a reform introduced by the Morrison government. We had a national commissioner in place before the royal commission was even called.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we have been supporting calls from RSL Australia and veterans advocates for the veterans services commissioner to be established as a Commonwealth statutory agency through purpose-specific legislation, as recommended by the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. Again, this was the clear message from the RSL, the advocates and the families of veterans—that this should be a standalone act, to build trust and ensure the independence of the commissioner. Veterans advocates, like Julie-Ann Finney, who joins us here today, and the respected interim head of the DVSC, Michael Manthorpe, told the Senate committee inquiry into the issue that it would be 'highly desirable' to create a standalone act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear. The only reason the Senate committee inquiry even occurred is that the coalition pressured the government into doing it. They were dragged kicking and screaming to have the inquiry. This government would be well advised to listen, for a change. The RSL has said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australian veterans who have made unique sacrifices in service of our nation deserve to know their interests are being protected by an oversight body that will act without fear or favour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RSL said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the DVSC should be established under a separate Act of Parliament as an independent body … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the coalition agrees. I urge the minister to listen to veterans; listen to their families, like Julie-Ann Finney; listen to veterans advocates; listen to mental health experts; and listen to the coalition and give our veterans the fully independent commissioner they desire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to direct my comments today towards the unique nature of military service and the need to ensure we properly support those who have served, both during and after their time in the Navy, the Army or the Air Force. At the time I announced the royal commission, in April 2021, alongside then prime minister Morrison, we said it was an opportunity for our nation to reset the agenda and unite the veterans community in what has been a very difficult, extraordinarily sensitive and incredibly complex issue for our veterans, their families and the Australian parliament for decades. The royal commission was a particularly harrowing and emotional time for many of our veterans, ADF personnel and their families who have lost their loved ones or who have been impacted in any way by their service. I say again: thank you for your service. A grateful nation owes you an enormous debt of gratitude, and we must keep doing better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to use a royal commission to seek the answers and solutions to the unacceptable level of suicide in the defence and veteran communities. There is no level of suicide which is acceptable to this place or to the wider community. We have to do better. So I do agree with the broad themes in the royal commission. Additional efforts are needed to harmonise and simplify the claims and rehabilitation system, and the coalition has voted alongside the government to seek to harmonise the legislation in that regard. I also agree that reducing the claims backlog has been a high priority for the Department of Veterans' Affairs since I took on the role in 2018 and since the new minister took on the role in 2022. That has been a combined effort over many years to reduce that backlog. I totally reject, though, any suggestion that the previous coalition government failed to act to improve the veterans system for defence personnel or for veterans themselves and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a job that I believe may never be finished, but I can point to more than a dozen significant reforms during my time as minister and during the term of the coalition government. I must say, on almost all of those occasions, it was with the support of my shadow minister at the time. We introduced free mental health care for veterans and their families. We started the process of building eight wellbeing centres in Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Albury-Wodonga, Nowra, Tasmania, South-East Queensland and Townsville. The current minister has built on the network of wellbeing centres. We introduced a psychiatric assistance dogs program for veterans with mental health issues—the first of its kind in Australia. We appointed the Defence Families Advocate to make sure families are recognised. There is an old joke that goes around military circles in relation to Army RSMs saying, 'Son, if the Army wanted you to have a family, they would have issued you with one. ' But we made sure that families were properly recognised with the Defence Families Advocate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We delivered the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant and the veterans' recognition package. We sought to overhaul Open Arms in support of a Vietnam veterans counselling service. We established the Prime Minister's National Veteran Employment Awards, which continues today. We commenced the establishment of the Joint Transitions Authority because we recognise that transition is the high-risk period. Transition is where things go wrong. Transition is where a serving member whose life has been associated with the uniform—their sense of purpose and the job they do—transitions to civilian life. It can be excruciatingly hard. The Joint Transition Authority is intended to ease that process and make sure support is provided, and that work continues today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We funded the redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial to tell the story of contemporary veterans, and that wasn't always popular amongst members opposite or in some parts of the community. But the importance of the Australian War Memorial redevelopment is to ensure that our modern veterans' stories are told at a time when they can walk into that building with their own families and tell their stories. That's what it's meant to do. It's a real credit to the Australian War Memorial that they're delivering this generational project to recognise the service and sacrifice of modern service personnel. We tell the story of World War I very well and World War II exceptionally well. Vietnam—not too badly. But, for more recent conflicts, there hasn't been enough room in the Australian War Memorial to tell their stories, unfortunately. This redevelopment project is of generational importance, and I commend the War Memorial and the board for continuing to deliver that project with money that was delivered by the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We added a question. This may seem like a small achievement, but I can assure you it was harder than you think. We added a question on military service to the 2021 census. So, for the first time, we were able to find out how many veterans we actually had in Australia, and then we could provide services in those communities, in a targeted way, to make sure we were supporting people in their communities. We delivered provisional access to medical treatment. We increased fees to health professionals to treat veterans. We improved financial support for veterans undertaking additional study. And the budget grew to more than $11 billion of support for veterans and their families. But more is needed. We've just heard from the minister at the despatch box—more is needed. I urge the government to build on these achievements, not tear them down. Australians can be proud of the fact that the budget for the Department of Veterans' Affairs has now grown to more than $14 billion. That's more than $14 billion of taxpayers' money provided each financial year to support veterans and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm going to say now will be contentious in some parts of our veteran community. I acknowledge that we have to walk a very fine line in this place when we engage in public debate on issues surrounding veterans and their families. There is no question that military service exposes our men and women in uniform to increased risks of physical and mental injuries. There is no doubt about that. They train at a high level. They have to train at that level to be ready to be deployed, and there are risks of injuries that go with that. When they are deployed, the trauma they can be exposed to can obviously cause long-term issues. So there's no question there at all that there have also been many occasions when Defence and DVA have failed to properly support our ex-service personnel. I agree that the system, at times, has been too slow to act, too hard to navigate and, often, too combative for veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's important to acknowledge that no two stories are the same. Our men and women might all wear the same uniform, but they are all individuals, and they have individual experiences. We need individually tailored support where it's required—or, sometimes, no help at all—as they transition to civilian life. Some people transition needing no help at all. So I say with respect and a high degree of caution that I do have concerns with the royal commission risking a false and perhaps dangerous narrative that everyone who serves in the Australian Defence Force will end up severely injured, broken and in need of lifetime medical support for their physical or mental injuries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In providing that platform to focus on the very real—and, sometimes, the perceived—deficiencies in our system of support for service personnel and our veterans, what was lost was the positive story of military service and the benefits it can provide to the individual and to the nation. They were sometimes lost in the public debate, and we need to reassure our veterans that they should not become despondent. Help is available, with open arms, through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. At a time when the Australian Defence Force is trying to attract and recruit its fair share of the best, brightest and most capable young Australians, the 'busted veteran' myth is a barrier to achieving our recruitment targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compounding this situation is that, right now, we have a veterans' compensation situation that is being hijacked by some unscrupulous fee-for-service advocates who are more interested in maximising any payout to our veterans to boost their own commissions than in the wellbeing of their clients. I urge the minister to take a close look at this issue. I know he will be exercised by it. Let's start, though, with this simplistic narrative that everyone who serves in the Army, the Navy or the Air Force will have a negative experience that will leave them with scars for life. It's undoubtedly true that the unique nature of military service exposes ADF personnel to risk, and it's equally true that our grateful nation owes our veterans the care and support they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have to remove the stigma of seeking help and support. We have to make sure that help is timely, and we also, as the minister has indicated, need to focus on wellbeing and a more holistic approach. But I caution, again, that it's completely untrue to imply that everyone will need medical help after ADF service, and we must not feed our veterans or our community a diet of helplessness and hopelessness, because it's damaging both to them and to their loved ones. The other thing that I'm concerned about is that it actually damages and creates a barrier to future job prospects if potential employers think they're recruiting damaged goods. I have heard stories from veterans where they were asked in a job interview: 'Do you have PTSD? I see you served in the Army.' It's just not fair. We need to make sure we have a balanced conversation in the public debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we walk a fine line because we have to get that balance right. We have to have help for those who need it. It has to be timely. But we have to make sure we don't label all ex-ADF personnel in that way. From my experience as a minister and as part of the ADFPP, I have met some incredible young Australians in our uniform all around the world. Enlisting to keep our nation safe appeals to people from all walks of life, often with varying motivations. Undoubtedly, for many, there's a strong sense of patriotism and a desire to serve a greater good, while for others it's simply a pathway to a university degree or trade qualification or receiving a full-time salary. It's actually a good career offering for the right people, and our conditions of service compare favourably to those of our Five Eyes partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many veterans have confided in me over the years that their service in the ADF made them into a better person and gave them the discipline, the leadership skills and the problem-solving ability which improved their lives, and many of them have come to this place and proven that. On transition, they often reflect with pride on the service, and they miss the camaraderie and sense of purpose they enjoyed as part of the unit. Defence is a major training organisation, and we need to make sure that people who serve well, train well and transition well can go on to have successful lives in the broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when ripping off the government seems to be regarded as a victimless crime in some circles in Australia, there are people who are perpetuating the 'broken veteran' myth to try and improve their own financial wellbeing through the advocacy system. We are seeing a cottage industry developing where unregulated advocates are charging excessive fees and, in some cases, percentage based commissions, with a sole focus on maximising a veteran's entitlement. I do urge the minister as part of his reform efforts to have a very close look at the advocacy system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I say again that the opposition is prepared to work in a bipartisan manner as much as we possibly can to assist the government in supporting our Australian Defence Force personnel, our veterans and their families. We stand ready to work positively to deliver the reforms that are needed in defence, in transition and in DVA itself. But we won't be silent. Where we see problems and failures of the government or departments, we will speak up. We are determined to provide a voice for our defence community in this place. As I said, I fear the system will never be perfect, but it's important that we continue to learn from any mistakes we've made in the past. And it's important that we don't feed a vicious media cycle of despondency, desperation and helplessness when help is available to our veterans and their families. The vast majority of the Australian Defence Force personnel are proud of their service. They will train well, they will serve well, they will transition well into the next stage of their lives, and they will be incredible contributors to civil society in our nation. But, for our veterans who experience difficulties for any reason whatsoever, we must give them and their families the support they need in a timely manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to keep investing and supporting the people who are already working today to help our veterans. There are literally thousands of Australians, both volunteers and paid staff members, who are working today as part of ex-service organisations to support our veterans through advocacy and through their hard work, and we want to thank them and continue to work with them and their families. Their contributions are already saving lives, and they deserve to be properly acknowledged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mustn't look backwards. We need to bank the improvements we've made and then work constructively to invest in new ideas and reform measures that can deliver a better system in the future. The royal commission has been an opportunity to unite the military community and the political class to achieve those positive outcomes in the interest of all Australians. For my part, I will continue to promote positive stories of service, notwithstanding the challenges and the difficulties that many of our servicemen and servicewomen face. At an uncertain time in our nation's history, it's important to note we have a well-led, world-class, highly respected, well-trained and incredibly capable Australian Defence Force, and we should all be proud of them. But it is a job with inherent risk of death or serious injuries, both physically and mentally. As a grateful nation, we owe them the best conditions of service we can afford to provide, every effort to ensure their mental and physical wellbeing and an opportunity to transition successfully to civilian life. For what they have done, this we will do. I thank the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're delivering once-in-a-generation reforms to aged care that give older Australians more choice, dignity and safe, high-quality care. We've continued to listen to older Australians, the workers who care for them and our aged-care providers, and we're stepping up to deliver more home-care support now and under the new Aged Care Act from 1 November. We've engaged in positive, constructive negotiations with the opposition over this sitting period, and we're grateful for their genuine desire to help us build a better aged-care system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing Home Care Packages Program has almost doubled in size in recent years, growing to around 300,000 people compared to 155,000 people just five years ago. The new Support at Home program will help even more older Australians stay at home for longer, with a higher level of care available to support people to stay close to family and community in the comfort of their own homes. This is a responsible decision that will deliver more care, faster, to the older Australians who need it most while maintaining the medium-term fiscal save that was a key pillar of our aged-care reforms last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To keep up with the increased demand, the Albanese government is fast-tracking the release of more home-care packages. We'll make an extra 20,000 home-care packages available in the next eight weeks until the new Aged Care Act comes into effect. Once the new Support at Home program comes into place, we'll provide support to a further 63,000 older Australians in the first eight months, by 30 June 2026.</span>

The bipartisan passage of the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2025 is the latest milestone in our generational aged-care reforms.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I'm pleased to speak to this request for amendments to the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2025, received from the Senate. These are historic amendments for this parliament. It is a testament to the importance of being constructive when we can and critical when we must. This is an important moment in this parliament because this is a moment where an arrogant government has been brought to heel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important for the House that we understand how we arrived here today. After months of coordinated pressure and sustained questioning in parliament, the coalition has forced the Albanese Labor government to belatedly release tens of thousands of home-care packages for older Australians who've been left waiting for too long. Labor promised 83,000 new packages from 1 July 2025 but instead decided to withhold that support. They blamed the sector. They blamed the bureaucrats. This out-of-touch government blamed everyone but itself. Because of Labor's delays, not a single new home-care package has been released this financial year. As a result, the priority waitlist has blown out to more than 108,000—a 400 per cent increase in just two years—whilst wait times have tripled. These are not just statistics; these are Australians. Tragically, almost 5,000 older Australians died in the past year while waiting for care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to a coordinated pressure campaign from the coalition, led by the shadow health and aged-care minister, Senator Anne Ruston, in the other place, the government has caved. We forced Labor to make a choice in this legislation: listen to the coalition and release these packages early or vote against the coalition and deny vulnerable Australians the support they desperately need. As we can see today, they have listened to the coalition and they have listened to older Australians. The truth is it took the coalition to force this arrogant Labor government to listen to older Australians and to us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation should never have happened. The money was in the budget. The capacity was there. Only Labor stood in the way. It's a black mark on this government that it withheld support from tens of thousands of older Australians who desperately needed it. Neither the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing nor the hapless Minister for Aged Care and Seniors has explained to Australians why it took the coalition holding their feet to the fire in the Senate to release this much-needed support. Given their performance this week, I'm not sure we should expect an honest explanation any time soon. But be under no illusion. These amendments represent a defeat for this government. This is not a deal, Prime Minister; this is a defeat. Labor has been forced into a humiliating backdown. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not about political wins or the government's backdowns. It never has been. This is a win for older Australians in desperate need of assistance. Australians who built this country died waiting for the packages they could have and should have accessed but were denied because of Labor's bad decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're Australians like Clara. Clara is 91 years old. She lives with her husband, who suffers from Parkinson's. Clara has been assessed as needing home-care support to help her stay living independently with her husband, but she has been told that she will not receive her home-care package until July 2026. There's Elliot. Elliot is 86 years old and lives at home with his wife. He was approved for a level 4 home-care package in March this year but was told it will be more than 12 months before he receives his package. In the meantime, both of his daughters are having to provide the care their parents need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the Australians we have fought for, these are the Australians we pushed the government for and these are the Australians who have had a win today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a crisis of the government's own making. We are proud to have forced this government into providing an additional 83,000 packages this financial year, but there is still more work to be done, and the coalition will continue to fight for older Australians with one clear goal: no-one should have to wait for the care they have been assessed as needing. </span>

                    </a>  yes—to bring forward 20,000 new home-care packages. Amendments passed by the Senate have forced the government to urgently negotiate and bring forward that release of 20,000 home-care packages and front-load the release of the Support at Home program from 1 November. The Greens have for a long time been pushing the government hard to take action, chairing a Senate inquiry into the issue and putting forward amendments to the government's aged-care legislation. My Greens colleague Senator Penny Allman-Payne has worked very hard at this, and it is a credit to the work of her, to Senator David Pocock and to Senator Ruston that this reform has been achieved. This will begin the work of addressing the urgent needs of over 200,000 older Australians waiting 12 months or more for basic care like showering, cooking and cleaning. But there are still over 200,000 people on the waiting list for Support at Home, and this win will barely touch the sides. We're still seeing care rationed and older people treated, sadly, like commodities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is looking more and more out of touch and desperate after being forced to change policy by the Greens and the crossbench. What is particularly concerning is how this government is allergic to transparency. They hid that the waiting list was not 87,000 but actually well over 200,000. They've hidden modelling on the financial impact on older people. They've hidden the fact that, until we forced them to, they were releasing no new packages at all. Together, we've ended those pointless delays and started getting older Australians the essential care that they really need. Labor has resisted all calls to do that right thing, so now the parliament has had to force them to. That is the power of the Greens and the crossbench working together, and it has made a real difference for older people in this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  It is an incredibly positive thing to rise and support these amendments. These amendments were hard fought, I think it's fair to say, and I want to talk to each of these amendments individually. The first amendment I would like to talk to is the 20,000 Home Care Packages that are going to be released immediately by the government, recognising that there are 106,000 people on the waiting list right now and recognising that there are 120,000 people waiting to be assessed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about these 20,000 packages, I think about a gentleman called Cyril Tooze. Cyril was a carer until he was 82—a paid carer for a gentleman with a disability. Cyril was waiting for his package, and he very well needed one of these 20,000 packages that are going to be released. Cyril ended up being hospitalised because he couldn't get that care at home last year. He was a tall man; he was about six foot tall. Cyril ended up being hospitalised and ended up choosing voluntary euthanasia because the package never came for Cyril. The packages didn't come for thousands of people who died in the last year nor, as we found out, for nearly 5,000 people this year. These were older Australians who died while waiting for a package. Cyril held my hand before he died. We had a bit of a party for Cyril, to celebrate his life, before he died. He said, 'Rebekha, I'm going to make a difference.' Well, it took a long time, but, to Cyril and all of the other older Australians, I hope you realise that all of us in here are fighting to make a difference for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 20,000 packages are excellent. They are a drop in the ocean, and I'd like to acknowledge and talk to some of the other amendments. The rest of those 83,000 packages that were promised by the government last December—around the time that Cyril passed away—are now going to be released in this financial year. That's still going to leave many, many older Australians on the waiting list, but, hopefully, it will mean that we'll get to a position in this place where people are not waiting up to a year to be assessed and then up to a year, or even longer in some cases, to actually get their package. People are dying; people are losing hope; and people cannot understand why, when they can't even lift their husband to get them into the shower and when their husband can't even walk because of neurological disease, they are still just a medium priority—they're not even given high priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that these amendments that have come down from the Senate are desperately needed by our nation, by our oldest people. We in here all enjoy the nation that we live in because of them. So I commend these amendments, which were very hard fought and won. Let us hope that we never again in Australia get to a position where we have nearly 5,000 Australians in a year dying waiting for care.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise in support of the amendments to the home-care packages that have been put through the Senate and have now returned to the House. I want to highlight why these are so important. It really comes back to my experience in my community in Wentworth. I was in Paddington recently at Five Ways, doing a pop-up office, and I had three people come and talk to me about their own experience of home-care packages and how they just could not understand—when they had been assessed as needing something, knew that they needed something and were doing their best as members of the community who wanted to stay at home—not being able to get the help that they needed to stay out of aged care. They could not understand why their packages were going to take months, or up to a year or so, for them to get that support that they had been identified as needing. They felt that, once a need was identified, the help would be there. This disconnect between the need being identified and recognised and the help being delivered was unintelligible to them. I think it's unintelligible to most Australians. I want to say that this is a really important change that has been put through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the government has been trying to make home aged care and care for older Australians more sustainable. That is a good thing. That is a very positive thing. But home care is really critical to that. Home care is both a good economic choice—if we can keep people out of aged care, it is better in terms of the cost—and, most importantly, a good choice for people's families and for people's own mental health. It is what they want. Both bringing the additional 20,000 packages and bringing forward those packages earlier in the year are really critical when we are seeing such a growth of people on the waiting list desperately needing help and not being able to get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge everyone who has played a part in this. I wrote to the government last year about my concerns with home-care packages, based on the feedback I'd got from constituents. I was proud to work with Senator Pocock and others earlier, just after the election, when there was concern that the packages would be delayed, to say that they should not be delayed. I've been proud to stand up with other members of the crossbench and across the parliament to say: 'This is important. These changes are required, and it's time to put them through.' This is a positive day for the parliament. This is a good choice, and I'm proud to have been part of that. Certainly my community will be extremely grateful for the changes that have been made to this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I also rise to support the release of these 20,000 home-care packages. I believe it is an important step forward for the parliament and also for the nation. Most people in our communities know how important home care is to our seniors and the difference that it makes to people's lives. I think everyone was shocked that these packages were being withheld. The feedback from the Calare electorate, in the Central West of New South Wales, is that the packages need to be released on the double and that we need to get help to our seniors to help with their amenity of life and the support that they need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend my crossbench colleagues, in particular, for leading the charge on this. The crossbench has been very vocal on this. It's an issue that is close to the hearts of many Australians. There are still about 121,000 people being assessed and 109,000 people waiting for packages, so this issue has not gone away. We, as a nation, must do much better to support our seniors and those in need. I commend everyone involved on the push for the release of these packages, particularly my crossbench colleagues and Senator Pocock, who have been right in there from the very beginning on this, pushing for these important changes and for this vital support to be released.</span>

During her illness, her former partner who was acting as her nominee incorrectly declared their family income, and a debt of $7,000 was raised against Ashley. Under the system as it exists at the moment, Ashley would be denied the special circumstances waiver because her former partner knowingly made a false declaration.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Productivity, Competition, Charities and Treasury</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill consists of measures designed to strengthen confidence in our markets, improve the way regulators operate and support long-term economic growth. Its provisions span areas as diverse as corporate disclosure, the regulation of charities, oversight of financial regulators, energy market protections and taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One measure of particular significance for productivity is the continuation of the $20,000 instant asset write-off until mid-2026. Its value lies in encouraging businesses to invest in new equipment and technology. Productivity is not only about working smarter, but also about working with better tools. When firms are able to expand and upgrade their capital stock, they achieve what's known as capital deepening—more capital per worker—which is one of the surest routes to higher productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By allowing immediate deductions, this measure reduces the barrier to making those investments and helps ensure that Australian workers are equipped to do their job more efficiently. Boosting productivity is a central focus of our government—reflected in the Treasurer's recent Economic Reform Roundtable, a valuable national conversation aimed at delivering higher living standards for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also recognises that strong markets depend on transparency. In our corporate sector, greater clarity about who holds influence over listed companies supports fairer and more efficient decision-making and ensures that directors and investors can respond on the basis of accurate information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the wider community, improved access to ownership information means that journalists, academics and others are better placed to shine light on potential concentrations of power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In civil society, too, openness matters. Allowing the charities regulator to speak more directly to the public where there are concerns of misconduct ensures that trust in the sector is not eroded by silence or uncertainty. In both domains—business and the non-profit sector—transparency provides the oxygen that accountability requires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other provisions of the bill ensure that reviews of our financial regulators are conducted with sufficient depth, that consumer safeguards in the energy market remain in place during the transition, and that the law continues to operate as intended through a set of technical amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these measures promote investment, transparency and accountability—the conditions on which stronger productivity and public confidence ultimately rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to each of the seven schedules in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill will improve the transparency of ownership and control of entities listed on Australian financial markets. Firstly, it broadens market disclosures to better capture interests arising through equity derivatives—closing a disclosure loophole and bringing Australia into greater alignment with many comparable international jurisdictions. It also strengthens the existing substantial holding and tracing notice regimes that govern the disclosure of interests in listed entities, while enhancing the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's regulatory enforcement powers and the penalties it can seek to help ensure compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Better ownership information will improve market efficiency, including by improving investors' ability to conduct due diligence on prospective acquisitions, supporting a more efficient allocation of resources. It will also give company directors and security-holders better visibility whenever someone may be seeking to build up influence over their companies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill further supports corporate transparency by providing greater access to beneficial ownership information to interested members of the public; including providing journalists and academics, who play a key role in initiating and encouraging public debate, with fee-free access to tracing notice registers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure builds on our government's corporate transparency achievements. Since 2022, Labor has implemented a suite of corporate transparency reforms aimed at curbing secrecy and strengthening accountability. Firms tendering for large government contracts are now required to disclose their country of tax residency. Australian listed and unlisted public companies must disclose the tax residency of their subsidiaries in their annual financial reports through a consolidated entity disclosure statement. Our government has implemented a world-leading public country-by-country reporting regime, requiring billion-dollar multinationals to disclose where they pay tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 will allow the commissioner of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission to make disclosures about new or ongoing investigations where the disclosure would prevent or minimise the risk of significant harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secrecy provisions currently prevent the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission from disclosing whether it is investigating alleged misconduct by a charity. This adversely impacts public trust and confidence in the sector and in the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission as an effective regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform will allow the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission to assure charities and donors that it is acting on issues of public concern and strengthening compliance, which will in turn boost public confidence that the sector is doing the right thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By increasing public trust and confidence in charities and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, this reform will help to ensure donors and philanthropists continue their support for the sector. This will contribute to the government's commitment to doubling philanthropy by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This builds on our government's work to strengthen Australia's civic fabric. Since coming to office, we have created a new pathway for community foundations to gain deductible gift recipient status and streamlined deductible gift recipient applications for environmental, harm-prevention, cultural and overseas aid organisations. We appointed widely respected sector expert Sue Woodward as charities commissioner. We refreshed the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Advisory Board, chaired by Sarah Davies, to better reflect the sector, bringing First Nations, CALD and youth voices to the table. We have been clear that charitable advocacy is welcome, and we have worked with states and territories to harmonise charitable fundraising rules across jurisdictions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has funded a new General Social Survey, adding questions on volunteering and cultural participation to sharpen our understanding of how giving, participation and purpose driven activity benefit communities. We've commissioned a once-in-a-generation Productivity Commission review of philanthropy and set about adopting its recommendations, including scrapping the $2-donation deduction threshold and consulting on increasing the minimum contribution for giving funds. We've begun work on the not-for-profit sector blueprint, whose recommendations span multiple portfolios across government. I thank the many charities and not-for-profits who joined Minister Plibersek and me for a roundtable at Parliament House on 5 August to discuss boosting productivity in the charity sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 changes the frequency of the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority review cycles. Increasing the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority review cycles to every five years will support the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority to deliver more comprehensive reviews of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. It will facilitate the delivery of more considered recommendations than is possible under the current biennial review cycle, which will improve the effectiveness of our financial system regulators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulators will also have additional time to respond to recommendations between reviews, allowing future panels to assess implementation meaningfully and direct their focus more productively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 4 and 5 of the bill amend various laws in the Treasury portfolio to ensure those laws operate in accordance with policy intent, make minor changes to improve administrative outcomes and remedy unintended consequences, as well as correct technical and drafting defects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations was notified in relation to amendments in schedules 4 and 5 of the bill in accordance with clauses 506 and 507 of the Corporations Agreement 2002.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The states and territories were notified in relation to amendments in schedule 5 of the bill in accordance with subclause 33(f) of the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Competition Policy 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 of the bill supports the Albanese government's ongoing efforts to improve electricity affordability and protect consumers in the energy market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The value provided by existing consumer protections in the energy market was recently reinforced by the review into the effectiveness of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Act 2019. The review examined retail and wholesale consumer protections embedded in part XICA of the Competition and Consumer Act. It found that the provisions in part XICA, created through the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Act 2019, had, on balance, likely been effective in constraining market misconduct and protecting consumers. To maintain those protections, the government is taking action to extend the sunset date of these provisions to 1 January 2031.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This work is part of a broader strategy to support the energy transition while maintaining affordability and fairness. It complements other initiatives as part of the energy transition and ensures that consumers remain protected. The relevant provisions are outlined in schedule 6, which detail the legislative amendments required to extend the sunsetting date of the consumer protections to 1 January 2031.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 7 of the bill amends the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to extend the $20,000 instant asset write-off until 30 June 2026, to improve cash flow and reduce compliance costs for small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Up to 4.1 million small businesses, with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million, will be able to immediately deduct eligible assets costing less than $20,000 until 30 June 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $20,000 threshold will apply on a per asset basis, so small businesses can instantly write off multiple assets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic research into the benefits of accelerated depreciation dates back to the seminal work in 1967 of Robert Hall and Dale Jorgenson in the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Economic Review</span>. Having studied under Dale Jorgenson, who died in 2022, it is a pleasure to be introducing a measure that follows in his intellectual legacy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will speed up the process of applying for a provider number, while all decisions to refuse a provider number would continue to be checked and authorised by the Chief Executive Medicare or their delegate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The premium reductions scheme allows eligible people to choose to get the rebate at the time they pay their private health insurance premiums, rather than pay the full cost of the premium, and then claim a deduction back through their tax return at the end of the financial year. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the scheme, the insurer reduces the premium payable by the policyholder by the amount of the rebate and then claims reimbursement of that amount through a system administered by Services Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 to the bill will make essential changes to allow regulations to be made to modernise assignments of the Medicare benefits process. This process underpins Medicare bulk-billing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the parliament passed the Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Assignment of Medicare Benefits) Act 2024, providing for generational change to modernise and simplify how patients assign their Medicare benefits. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes recognised that patients and healthcare providers are no longer using paper based processes that existed when Medicare was first set up over 40 years ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will build on these changes and remedy minor issues identified during the drafting of supporting regulations for the Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Assignment of Medicare Benefits) Act 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also extend the time available for software vendors to build and test new digital solutions, and for medical industry providers and patients to prepare for the changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bulk-billing is vital for timely and equitable access to health care. Access to bulk-billed medical care helps with cost-of-living pressures and ensures every Australian receives the best health care they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides for regulations to specify the circumstances in which enduring bulk-billing agreements can be made. This will streamline the administration of MBS claiming, when services are bulk-billed by a preferred provider or organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also enable the minister to issue a legislative instrument to categorise professional services for application in bulk-billing assignment agreements.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will support the use of pre-assignment agreements, giving patients simple yet meaningful information to assign their benefits before services have been provided. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will support simplified and streamlined billing for privately insured hospital systems, so they do not have to deal with bills from multiple providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will clarify wording to ensure that any eligible person covered under a private health insurance policy can assign their own Medicare benefits, not just the person in whose name the policy is held. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also amends mandatory notification requirements to reduce the administrative burden and cost for providers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will delay the commencement of new assignment-of-benefit arrangements from 9 January 2026 to 1 July 2026. This will provide stakeholders with an additional six months to prepare before the new arrangements commence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 to the bill will amend part VD of the Health Insurance Act 1973 to ensure the consequences for bonded medical program participants who withdraw from the program or fail to complete their 'return of service obligation' are fair. The changes balance the personal circumstances of the bonded participant with the broader interests of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides capacity to make rules to ensure that past work completed by bonded participants—delivering health services in regional, rural and remote locations in Australia—can be fairly and consistently counted towards their 'return of service obligation'.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I rise this morning as the shadow minister for regional communications to speak on this bill. The Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025 primarily seeks to amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to establish a mandatory carriage service provider registration scheme, make industry codes directly enforceable, increase maximum civil penalties and allow the Minister for Communications to increase infringement notice penalties. The bill complements other telecommunications legislation by strengthening consumer protections, providing the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, with greater enforcement powers and aligning with the broader goal of a consumer-centric telecommunications sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports this bill, which is a step in the right direction when it comes to enhancing consumer protections in telecommunications. However, this bill is not a comprehensive review of consumer protections in the telecommunications sector, something which the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee, RTIRC, called for in their December 2024 report, which the government has failed to respond to. There is a legislative requirement to respond to this report within six months. They are three months overdue so far. There are 14 recommendations, and we are yet to hear a peep from the minister. The coalition's form in government on responding to RTIRC reports within the legislative timeframe was far stronger than Labor's, and I hope the government's response to the RTIRC report is not waiting until the universal outdoor mobile obligation, or UOMO, legislation passes the parliament. UOMO is by no means a comprehensive solution to shortcomings in regional telecommunications. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I moved on Monday that the Albanese government be held to account for failing to meet a legislated deadline to table its response to a key regional telecommunications report. This is yet another example of Labor's lack of focus on regional Australia and another demonstration of their ongoing lack of transparency. Regional people deserve better. While Australians wait for the government's late response to the Regional Telecommunications Review, they also want answers from Labor about when the UOMO legislation will be introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me take a moment to paint a brief picture of the experience of regional Australians when it comes to telecommunications. On that front, I can tell you that metropolitan Australians and regional Australians are not in the same boat. Just yesterday, I met with Rhys Turton, a proud farmer and Chair of GrainGrowers. He lives in York in the Western Australian wheatbelt. Rhys lives 17 kilometres from a Telstra tower and says that, while the mobile phone network is workable from Monday to Friday, come the weekend, he has to drive up the hill and stay in his ute. When 5,000 people drive out of Perth, he can't make a call or send a text, even with boosters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rhys went on to tell me that data and connectivity are a big part of his agricultural business and, when they fail, the impact on productivity is huge. He says: 'If we have a vehicle breakdown, I go to the web and pull up a parts manual after driving to the top of the hill. If I call the service guy and the guy says he will ring me back, do I wait on the top of the hill to take his call?' How can people like Rhys be expected to run a productive business, one that drives our economy, while sitting around on the top of a hill waiting for a phone call? He also says: 'I am sick of spending money for a service that isn't a proper service. I feel my argument is so basic. I had better reception on CDMA.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is ridiculous that regional Australians put up with such poor connectivity. Rhys's story illustrates the challenges country people face—Australians who technically do have coverage of some sort under our existing terrestrial mobile network. Regional Australians become digital lifehackers, experts in messing around to use the limited service that is available. But as soon as congestion builds up, service goes out the window. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, TIO, received 51,854 complaints from consumers living in regional, rural and remote Australia between 2021 and 2024. Regional Australians are indeed getting a raw deal. I don't need the TIO to tell me this. I know it to be true based on my own experience and the experience of constituents across Mallee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constituent complaints range from system faults to poor service quality, poor mobile service coverage, outages and accessibility barriers. The TIO's report highlights that faults and service problems often take longer to resolve in the regions and that, often, mobile service coverage is poor or non-existent. For example, the ombudsman referred to cases where 'a regional customer may report faults over several years without any lasting improvements to their services'. I'd like to know how many people in metropolitan Melbourne or Sydney would tolerate that. Additionally, the TIO heard from consumers who signed up to a mobile service after being told that their mobile would work in their area, but, when returning home to a remote location, found they had no service. Regarding satellite services, the TIO's complaint data shows that regional consumers continue to experience unreliable connections and service quality problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to highlight that, during a cost-of-living crisis, regional Australians pay the same price on their mobile phone plans as people in the inner cities who get far higher download speeds and service reliability. Returning to Rhys's experience, which I mentioned earlier, the RTIRC report talks to his exact issue, stating:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">…existing mobile networks in many regional areas are under pressure and facing congestion and capacity issues that require urgent attention—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important in the context of technology that is changing at a considerable pace, where low-Earth-orbit, LEO, satellite technology presents new opportunities for access to voice-capable broadband connectivity within fixed premises in the bush. It also presents opportunities to expand basic mobile phone connectivity in areas where there is currently none and in places where expanding the terrestrial network is simply not feasible. We cannot put mobile towers every 14 kilometres. It's just not going to work. The expense is enormous. For those who don't know, it's around a million dollars per tower. We must invest in up-to-date technology. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be realistic about the technology advances, what they look like and the timeframes involved; be aware of what industry is doing or likely to continue to do off their own bat because it makes commercial sense; and listen to the experience and needs of consumers in the regions, who are often most aware of what really makes a difference on the ground. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the experience of telecommunications for regional Australians on the ground, the 3G network shutdown is a prime example of the failings of the Albanese Labor government. The 3G network shutdown in Australia, completed by major telcos in 2024, aimed to repurpose spectrum for enhanced 4G and 5G services. However, the Albanese government's management of the shutdown of the 3G network was a complete mess. I called time and again for the former minister to prevent the foreseeable calamity of a rushed 3G shutdown, and the Albanese government was very slow to act. Even then, the 3G shutdown was marred by significant failings, widespread disruptions, a surge in complaints and ongoing service losses for some consumers, particularly in the regions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite promises of equivalent or improved coverage, 4G or 5G signals do not reach as far as 3G in some terrains, creating new black spots. This was particularly acute in rural areas with fortuitous 3G coverage—that is, unofficial signals beyond the mapped areas, which telcos did not commit to replicating. In regional or remote areas, consumers report 4G is unreliable or absent where 3G actually worked, resulting in phones dropping to SOS mode or having no signal at all, requiring them to drive up hills or climb towers for reception, as Rhys has to do. And I have to say I experience this on many of my Mallee roads. I have conversations going on the telephone while I'm driving, they drop out and they have to be called again and again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thousands of consumers have been left with worse or no coverage at all, particularly in rural and remote areas. Farmers' agtech equipment has been rendered useless. There is no coverage on their properties to call triple 0 if there is an accident or emergency. People with life-saving health devices are having to charge them constantly because the device is searching for a signal that isn't coming, rendering the device useless because it isn't on them while it's on the charger. At their own cost, because of this government's failures, people are installing Starlink satellites for their homes and properties because the lack of access is quite literally threatening lives and livelihoods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been reports of poor handling of consumer complaints about their loss of service post the 3G shutdown. It isn't good enough, and the Albanese government should be ashamed of their lack of response to help the people impacted. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope I have done justice to the bleak nature of the regional telecommunications experience for consumers so far this morning.

As our highest priority, the Nationals are committed to working with consumers and the telecommunications sector to design an updated universal service obligation that ensures that regional Australians have the connectivity required to enable economic participation and maximise productivity gains, and have access to high-quality educational content, virtual health care and meaningful social connection. I call on this government to lift their game.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263427" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRISKEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  The Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025 may appear to be about abstract regulation and technical changes, but in reality it is about fairness and keeping us connected. It is about making sure that families, small businesses and workers in communities like mine in Maribyrnong and right across the country get a fair go when it comes to the services we rely on every single day. We all know what it feels like when a phone line goes down, when the internet cuts out or when we're hit with an unfair bill and left on hold for hours. For a parent, losing connection may mean that their child can't finish their school project that's due the next day. For a small business, it might mean losing customers that simply can't wait. For an older Australian, it might mean not being able to call a loved one or a doctor when they need to the most. These are not small inconveniences; they are things that cause real stress in already busy households. They are the moments where working people lose time that they don't have and small businesses lose money that they can't spare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For families already juggling the rising cost of living and small businesses working hard to keep the doors open, these failures cut deep. They cost money. They cost time. They cost trust. And they leave people feeling powerless against the big corporations, who seem untouchable. That's why this bill matters. Telecommunications is the infrastructure of modern life. It's how kids do their homework, how parents talk to their families overseas, how local small businesses connect with customers and how workers earn their living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives Australians protections that they should have had a long time ago. It arms the regulator, ACMA, with the teeth it needs to hold dodgy telcos accountable. It lifts penalties for bad behaviour from $250,000 to nearly $10 million or more for the larger companies—no more shrugging off fines as simply a cost of doing business. It creates a register of service providers so dodgy operators can't hide in the shadows and rip people off. It makes compliance with industry codes mandatory so families and small businesses aren't waiting months for regulators to step in. That is fairness in action. That is Labor delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me pause on the carriage service provider, or CSP, register, because this is significant reform. Right now, there is no single comprehensive list of who is operating in the telecommunications market. That means a provider can set up, take people's money and, in some cases, cause real harm, all the while flying under the radar. For such an essential piece of social and economic infrastructure, this is not on. This bill fixes that. It creates a national register, a transparent list of providers who are operating legitimately. For families, this means confidence that the company selling you a phone plan is accountable. For small businesses, it means knowing that your internet provider is properly monitored. For industry as a whole, it means a level playing field, because those who do the right thing won't be undercut by dodgy operators who cut corners. And, importantly, the regulator will have the power to shut down providers who pose an unacceptable risk to consumers. That's not a power that will be used lightly, but it will finally give ACMA the power it needs to stop harm before it spreads. We've seen this work in the energy sector, where regulators can exclude retailers who fail customers. Bringing that same power to telecommunications is just common sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another vital part of this bill is the modernising of the penalty framework. For too long, the fines in telecommunications lagged behind other sectors, like in energy, banking and consumer law. That left telcos operating under weaker laws than in industries facing similar risks. This bill fixes it. It brings telecommunications penalties in line with those other sectors. That means, when a company breaks the rules, the Federal Court can look not just at a flat fine but at the scale of the misconduct. Penalties can be tied to the benefit a company may have made from breaking those rules or to a percentage of their turnover. Why does this matter? It means that the punishment fits the crime. A giant multinational won't get away with the same slap on the wrist as a small provider. The court can scale the penalty to the size of the business and the seriousness of the offence. That's fairness. That's consistency. And it means Australians can trust that the rules apply equally, no matter how big the company is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of the cafe owner in Ascot Vale, who can't serve customers if their EFTPOS goes down; the tradie in Keilor East, who relies on their phone to get the next job; and the logistics company in Tullamarine that loses money every time the internet drops out. Under the coalition, these businesses were left to fend for themselves. Under Labor we're making sure the rules work for them, not against them. For workers too, whether it's a transport relying on an app, a nurse swapping shifts or a teacher delivering lessons online, this bill protects their livelihoods by ensuring the services they depend on are reliable and fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest about how we got here. For nearly a decade, the Liberals and the Nationals had the chance to act. Those opposite had the chance to stand up to the big telcos, but they chose not to. They left penalties so low that the worst offenders could treat them as loose change and just a cost of doing business. They left regulators underpowered. They left families, workers and small businesses exposed. Let's not forget the NBN, a second-rate system built on copper that is still holding back households and businesses today. That was their choice. That is their legacy. The coalition like to talk about standing up for small businesses. But, when push came to shove, they were nowhere. They didn't have their back, but we do. We are fixing the mess they left behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of a bigger story—a story of government putting fairness back at the heart of our economy. Since coming to office, Labor has backed people in financial hardship. We've made it a legal requirement for telcos to provide proper support for customers doing it tough. That means families in Maribyrnong who hit a rough patch are treated with compassion not given more stress. We've protected those experiencing family and domestic violence. Survivors can now safely and quickly manage their phone services without tipping off an abuser—because everyone deserves safety, dignity and connection. We've cracked down on scams. By working across telecommunications, banking and digital platforms, we've helped stop Australians, including retirees and small businesses, from losing their savings to criminal scammers. We've invested in regional and local connectivity. Through mobile blackspot programs, on-farm solutions and community pilots, we're making sure small businesses and workers in every corner of this country can compete, succeed and stay connected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean in practice? It means a small retailer in Kensington can stay connected to suppliers without outages cutting into their margins. It means a shiftworker in Gladstone Park can rely on their phone to organise care for their kids. It means a farmer outside Melbourne can use digital tools to grow their business. These are real protections, real investments and real changes that make life better for working people and small businesses. That's what a Labor government does. We put people first, and we put fairness first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Maribyrnong, fairness is not just an idea; it is lived every single day. It's lived by the migrant families in Flemington, who depend on reliable internet so their kids can keep up with their classmates and so they can stay connected to loved ones overseas. It's lived by the factory workers in Airport West, where a reliable phone network keeps production moving and shifts coordinated. It's lived by the small businesses in Avondale Heights and Strathmore, where the EFTPOS transaction matters and where a dropped connection can mean lost sales. It is lived by those parents and young professionals working from home in Moonee Ponds and Aberfeldie, who rely on fast, dependable broadband to reach new markets, engage with their colleagues and attend virtual meetings. And it is lived by older Australians right across our community, who deserve the peace of mind of being able to call their family, their doctor or emergency services without worrying that the line will fail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When telecommunications systems fail, it's not just a technical glitch; it's people in our community being disconnected, losing income and feeling isolated. That is why this bill is so important to my community in Maribyrnong and right across the country. It says to every person in my community, 'You matter.' It says to the cafe owner in Niddrie, 'Your business matters.' It says to the nurse in Essendon juggling shifts, 'Your job matters.' It says the family in Glenroy, 'Your connection to each other and the world matters.' The people of Maribyrnong expect fairness. They expect accountability, and, with this legislation, the Albanese Labor government is delivering just that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians had a choice at the last election between two very different approaches: the coalition, with weak protections, dodgy operators running riot and corporate lunches, and Labor, with tough enforcement, fair rules and protections that put families, workers and small businesses first. To no-one's surprise, they voted for a fair go. This legislation is doing just that—bringing fairness to the forefront, building trust among consumers and providing much-needed accountability. It is about putting people back at the heart of the telecommunications system. That's what the Albanese Labor government is delivering, and that's why I stand here proudly to commend this bill to the House. </span>

                    <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  The Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025 makes changes to the Telecommunications Act to strengthen consumer safeguards, something we should all agree is a top priority. The bill will create a register of carriage service providers, enable the direct enforcement of industry codes, amend the existing two-step process for the application of penalty amounts for infringement notices and increase the maximum penalty for breaches of the codes from $250,000 to $10 million. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill will create a new carriage service provider registration scheme. This new registration scheme will require all telecommunications providers to apply to the Australian Communications and Media Authority for registration to operate in Australia. This will provide ACMA, as the regulator for the sector, with visibility of all operators in the Australian market, of which there are an estimated 1,500. This will ensure ACMA is able to educate, monitor and, where necessary, take swift enforcement action for breaches of any codes or standards. Should providers breach their obligations or pose a risk to consumers, ACMA will have the ability to cancel their registration to operate. These arrangements are similar to those in the energy sector, where the Australian Energy Regulator has the power to exclude operators from the market where there is a risk to consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the scheme, providers will also be required to report all cybersecurity incidents. Where there is a cyber breach, the appropriate bodies must be notified and remedial action taken swiftly. Protecting people's personal data and information is of the upmost importance, so ensuring there is swift action when these incidents occur will ensure that Australians' private information is protected from fraud and scams. Full visibility of all operators will also ensure ACMA can target compliance and enforcement activities and, when necessary, take appropriate action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill amends the act to make registered industry codes directly enforceable by ACMA. The telecommunications industry has a co-regulation model by which industry is responsible for the preparation of codes which are then submitted to ACMA for registration. Once a code is registered with ACMA and enforced, the code must be complied with by the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practice, what has been established under the act is a two-step enforcement process. If there is a complaint of wrongdoing or a breach of an industry code, ACMA will direct a provider to comply, essentially issuing a warning for them to correct their behaviour and to do the right thing. Should they not, ACMA's enforcement powers then become available. This enforcement action can include penalties through the Federal Court, enforceable undertakings or the issuing of an infringement notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, part 6 of the act says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compliance with an industry code is voluntary unless the ACMA directs a particular participant in the telecommunications industry … to comply with the code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This phrasing has led to a misconception that compliance with industry codes is voluntary. As the explanatory memorandum to this bill states, while code compliance is technically voluntary, after ACMA issues a direction to comply or a formal warning to a provider, it can then take enforcement action if the provider continues the noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since January 2024, ACMA has issued 19 formal warnings, one remedial direction, 16 directions to comply, four enforceable undertakings and infringement notices totalling close to $16 million. Some of these breaches relate to people's privacy and safety, which are of the utmost importance. For example, there were seven notices issued to providers in 2024 for breaches of the emergency call database rules. These rules require the telco providers to keep a person's telephone number and address updated so that, when the number calls triple 0, emergency services—police, fire or ambulance—are deployed to the correct address the first time. Adherence to this code is vital. People's lives depend on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement to monitor and report suspected spams and spoof numbers is another important one. If telcos aren't adhering to the code, the impact on people, financially, psychologically and emotionally, is significant. In 2024, of scam types, phone scams led to the highest overall losses, with more than $107 million lost by nearly 2,200 people. Since the start of 2024, ACMA has issued 10 directions to comply with the reducing scam calls and SMS code, but none of these resulted in a financial penalty to providers, because of the two-step process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill will strengthen ACMA's powers and the speed at which they can use them, to provide an even greater protection for consumers and ensure we have responsible operators in our telecommunications sector. The changes in this bill will make compliance with industry codes mandatory in the first instance, removing the requirement for a two-step process before ACMA can take enforcement action. There'll be no more warning shots, ensuring more immediate action can be taken for breaches of codes. I will note, given much scrutiny of the telecommunications sector over recent years, that this is a change the sector itself has called for. Notably, the Australian Telecommunications Alliance, which is a peak body for the industry, has been calling for these reforms since 2023. These changes will strengthen ACMA's powers to ensure the regulatory regime is as robust as it can be and that operators are held to the highest standards—as all Australians expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will increase penalties issued to providers for breaches of industry codes and standards from $250,000 to $10 million. The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have long advocated for civil penalty reform to ensure penalties for breaches reflect the severity of the breach and the harm caused. The increase in the penalties will address this and align the telecommunications penalty framework to those in the energy and banking sectors, competition legislation and Australian consumer law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes important changes to strengthen protections for consumers and the integrity of the telecommunications industry. They are changes which the coalition will support, but let's not forget about the failures of this government when it comes to telecommunications. The Albanese Labor government's botched closure of the 3G network has left many areas right across the country with little or no telephone service. Their shutdown of the 3G network was a complete mess. Thousands of consumers have been left with worse coverage or no coverage at all, particularly those in regional, rural and remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers have had their ag tech equipment, like soil monitors and weather stations, rendered useless. For years, we have been pushing our agriculture sector to upgrade their business operations with the newest and best technology. They have spent an absolute fortune doing so, and, after the 3G closure, many businesses had their equipment fail. Worse still, where these locations no longer have coverage, they can't call for help on their properties when they need it. People with life-saving health devices are having to charge them constantly because the devices are searching for a signal that just isn't coming. It renders the device useless because it isn't on them; it's on charge. At their own cost, because of this government's failure, people are installing Starlink satellites for their homes and properties because of the lack of access. It's quite literally threatening lives and livelihoods. It isn't good enough, and the Albanese Labor government should be ashamed of their lack of response to help people impacted by the closure of the 3G network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding the failures I have just highlighted, the coalition will support this legislation. It does provide stronger protections for consumers and strengthens the integrity of the sector. I commend the bill to the House and move the second reading amendment. I move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the debate on the Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025. The introduction and passage of the enhancing consumer safeguards bill delivers on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to keeping Australians connected no matter where they live by strengthening telecommunication consumer protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The enhancing consumer safeguards bill was first introduced into the 47th Parliament in February this year. It passed the House without amendment and was considered by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills but lapsed when the 47th Parliament was prorogued. It is for this reason we are, again, passing this legislation, because consumer protection is paramount, and I'm happy to speak on the bill again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill strengthens the compliance and enforcement tools available to Australia's telecommunications regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA. This will enable the regulator to better protect Australian consumers from poor and harmful telecommunication practices. The bill increases the civil penalties that the Federal Court can issue for breaches of industry code and industry standards from $25,000 to nearly $10 million. The bill modernises the civil penalties framework so that the Federal Court has the option to issue fines for regulatory breaches which can include $10 million, three times the benefit gained for regulatory breach or 30 per cent of turnover. Currently, civil penalties for breaches of industry codes and standards are not commensurate with the harm caused or high enough to deter noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to increase the maximum general civil penalty for breaches of industry codes and standards from 25,000 to 30,300 penalty units. This is the equivalent of just under $10 million at the time of drafting, to align with penalties currently available for breaches of service provider determinations. It means that penalties for all these instruments will be aligned to the 30,300 penalty units. The amendment will also strengthen the penalty framework for industry codes, industry standards and service provider determinations to allow for penalties based on the value of benefit obtained from the conduct or turnover of the relevant provider. This will allow for penalties greater than $10 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This penalty framework better aligns with those in other relevant sectors, like energy and banking, and under the Australian Consumer Law. It more adequately reflects the communications market and the varying size of the entities engaged in the market, ranging from small-to-medium businesses to large corporations. It allows the Federal Court to determine the appropriate penalty imposed on an entity for a breach. The bill also expands and clarifies the authority of the Minister for Communications to increase infringement notice penalties so that ACMA can issue for breaches of industry code, industry standards and service provider determinations. This will ensure the regulator remains flexible and responsive and can be adapted over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes the carriage service provider registration scheme to increase visibility of providers operating in the market and to stop the operation of dodgy carriage service providers, who pose an unacceptable risk to consumers. A carriage service provider has a broad definition under the Telecommunications Act 1997. However, in simple terms, it's an entity that uses a carrier's facilities to supply telecommunications services like phone or internet to the public. Currently, there's no comprehensive list of providers operating in the market. This hampers ACMA's efforts to proactively educate carriage service providers about their obligations and target compliance and enforcement activity. Establishing a carriage service provider registration scheme will increase the visibility of the market and provide ACMA and other government agencies the ability to educate providers, streamline complaints and compliance processes and create better overall market accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997 will also empower ACMA to stop providers operating in a market who pose unacceptable risks to consumers or who risk significant consumer harm. This will provide a deterrent for significant noncompliance and will increase the trust of consumers in the registered carriage service providers, including new or smaller providers. This is similar to the energy sector, where the Australian Energy Regulator has the power to exclude energy retailers from the market and has used this power to quickly prevent and stop consumer harm. ACMA's power to exclude carriage service providers from the market is expected to be used as a measure of last resort, with suitable arrangements for review of decisions, avenues for registration and maintenance of connectivity for impacted consumers. This reform means that the carriage service providers that are doing the wrong thing will face consequences, and consumers will be better protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the bill makes the telecommunications industry codes directly enforceable by ACMA, incentivising industry compliance and enabling the regulator to take swift action to address consumer harm. ACMA currently cannot take direct enforcement action for breaches of the industry codes it has registered under part 6 of the Telecommunications Act, no matter how egregious. Under the Telecommunications Act 1997, compliance with the industry codes is initially technically voluntary. For breaches found, ACMA could only direct a provider to comply with the code or issue a formal warning. ACMA can only take stronger enforcement action if the provider continues its noncompliance—that is, if it fails to observe the directions given by ACMA. This isn't good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, this bill introduces amendments to part 6 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 to make compliance with the industry codes mandatory and remove the need for ACMA to direct a particular participant to comply with the code in the first instance. This is a measure that will make our laws stronger and more enforceable. Since coming to office, the Albanese Labor government has been working to deliver better telecommunications and to better protect the people who use it. These are just a few things that we've already delivered: a new industry standard requiring telecommunications companies to provide adequate support to consumers experiencing financial hardship and a new industry standard requiring telecommunications companies to support and assist consumers experiencing domestic, sexual and family violence. This came into force on 1 July this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 was amended to introduce consistent obligations on the telecommunications, banking and digital platform sectors to prevent, detect and disrupt scams. The Albanese Labor government is also delivering a more connected Australia by investing in regional connectivity. The $55 million round 8 of the Mobile Black Spot Program is under assessment. There's been $50 million for Regional Roads Australia Mobile Program Pilot schemes, including $8 million for Victoria and Western Australia and $10 million for New South Wales. The pilot programs will test new and innovative solutions to increase mobile communications coverage on regional highways and major roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Round 3 of the regional connectivity program awarded over $115 million towards 74 projects that respond to local priorities with the objective of maximising economic opportunities and social benefits for regional, rural and remote communities. This included $7.4 million towards seven projects targeting improved connectivity for First Nations communities in Central Australia from a dedicated Central Australia stream. Two successful rounds of the On the Farm Connectivity Program have provided over $30.4 million in rebates, delivering on thousands of connectivity solutions for primary producers. $20 million has been committed to round 3 of the program, which will open later in 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was glad to have a chance to speak on the legislation earlier this year. I know how important this is to make this system more accountable and to stop companies from ripping people off. For too long, the regulator hasn't been given the necessary tools to make sure the telecommunications companies are doing the right thing. The Albanese Labor government has been working to improve our regulators, from strengthening the financial systems regulator to establishing the National Anti-Corruption Commission. We believe, in this country, that it doesn't matter how big you are or what wealth and power you have—no-one is exempt from consequences, no-one is above right or wrong, and no-one is above the law. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I'd like to start by acknowledging the previous speaker and the sentiment that she finished with, which is that the bill is focused on there being no standard, for an Australian, where anybody is above what is right or wrong. It's a point that we in this parliament, and those who have had the great privilege of serving in parliament, should all reflect upon and is perhaps something that the former premier of Victoria should be thinking about at this important moment in the context of his behaviour in Beijing in the past 24 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting to the Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025, this legislation, on the surface of it, is not one that should necessarily quicken the blood or excite many of the members in this House. It's to do with ACMA regulations in the context of making sure there are appropriate standards in place and extending them beyond carriage providers, and I get that, for a lot of people, this may not be a very exciting or enthusing topic. Of course, it's very important. When legislation's drafted, particularly for telecommunications or technology—technology will always outpace regulation and the law. In one sense, that's actually a good thing. Technology is moving at a pace that is faster than government. Government should be slower because it is calm, it is methodical, and, when it seeks to impose a standard, it is universal, whereas technology, by its nature, is dynamic, it is exciting, and it seeks to move faster, because it's reflective of human need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I've always been so excited about technology and excited about the potential not just of things like internet, of course, and telecommunications but also of what artificial intelligence can do. But we're also mindful of the human impact, and, of course, that's where law comes in to maintain standards and ethics but also to make sure that, where there's an overstep or a breach, government does its proper job to secure safety, dignity and security. And that's a constant balance for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But another thing we have to look at is how law can be weaponised by government to seek to silence or censor people. So I look at this bill—and we're going to support it—but I do so, frankly, with caution. I'm old enough—and I'm not that old—to remember the last time we had a Labor government. There are members in this chamber who weren't here and are now, bright eyed and bushy tailed—some elected in 2025 and some that were elected before then—sitting on the government benches, proudly wearing the moniker of the Australian Labor Party—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TIM WILSON:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Chesters. But I'm sure you're going give me a whole 15 minutes all over again. I was in full flight! That's okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm old enough to remember when there were former Labor members sitting on the benches of this parliament on the government side, during the last term of a Labor government, debating legislation. I wasn't here; I was but a member of the public concerned about the future direction of this country. I remember when Labor members were sitting on those benches, and what were they using telecommunications powers for? They were using them to shut down the media—to silence and regulate the media, look at pathways to introduce internet censorship and limit what Australians could see when they didn't like what Australians were searching for. They looked, particularly, to impose different pathways of internet censorship, because they wanted to control people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said this in this parliament many times before: the objective of the Labor Party at every stage of your life is to control Australians. They want to control education so they can control what your children learn and how they see the world. They want to control the workplace so that unions can control you and your standards. They want to control housing so that you rent and they can control how you live and make you dependent. They want to control you on a salary so that you never have the dignity and independence of owning your own small business. They want to control your superannuation through an industry superfund so that you never have the independence and dignity of an SMSF to manifest and manage your own destiny. And, of course, when it comes to telecommunications powers, it is the most wonderful backstop for them to be able to go on and control the information you seek, how you can access it and, even with the wonders of mobile telephony and technology, stop you accessing the information that you seek.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I look at this legislation—I look at every piece of legislation in the context of telecommunications—and my starting position is that I look at the minister, I look at those at the table, I look at those on the opposition benches, and I go, 'I never start from a position of trust,' because I've seen what you've done before. I know your natural temptation to control the Australian people and how you weaponise this legislation to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You just need to look at their performance in the past week. We talked about it earlier in the week. Think about the gift that they have been given by the Australian people of a 94-seat majority and the trust that they have been given. What are they using—or abusing—that trust to do at the moment? Introduce a veil of secrecy and shut a curtain down over this parliament and Canberra to silence journalists, to limit their capacity to access information and to limit scrutiny of this parliament. They have made it harder for Australians to submit freedom-of-information requests to scrutinise decisions of government. They have introduced fees to make it harder for people to access basic information about how public servants and the government are making decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen how they want to literally abolish pathways for reviews of decisions in the context of Defence medals. I have never thought that this was a priority of the Australian government, but, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis when people are dealing with the realities of financial stress and getting to the supermarket with a red basket, this is their priority. When it comes to the powers and the priorities they have, this is where it is. It is not based on how they empower the Australian people. When it comes to telecommunications and introducing standards, I always look at them with a high degree of scrutiny because the government's focus has never been on how they empower the Australian people; it has been on how they control the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xA;          background-color:;&#xA;        &#xA;    background:yellow;&#xA;  ">
                    </span>It doesn't mean there aren't important measures that need to be addressed through telecommunications powers. One of the biggest problems we face in this country right now—and it's a big challenge in the context of Victoria; you can speak to the member for Mallee—is the proliferation of crime. Crime is a massive problem, no matter where you go in Victoria. The failure of Victorian government to address the problems of crime—whether it's in the streets of Black Rock, Beaumaris, Brighton, Bentleigh, McKinnon or Ormond. Throughout the Goldstein electorate, there are violent home invasions, people breaking into people's houses, or scams and cybercrime, which is going on all across the country. That was why community safety and crime were such important issues in the Goldstein electorate at the election, including the proliferation of antisemitism, which was manifest both in physical form and on telecommunications platforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we also took to the election was the importance of having mandatory minimum sentences in the context of online sexual violence and crimes. That isn't the priority of this government. Closing FOI pathways for Australians is. Closing Defence medal review pathways is. Stopping the access of the opposition to be able scrutinise the decision-making government is their priority—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TIM WILSON:</span>
                    </a>  'Shame,' says the member for Mallee, and she's right. Stopping violent sexual predators on online platforms probably should be a priority for this government, but it isn't. It's certainly one of our priorities. That's what we should be addressing through telecommunications platforms. Whether it is cybercrime, sexual violence, scams or violent home invasions with machetes—these are pretty important issues for this country, but they're not the priorities of the current government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the other thing we need to address through telecommunications platforms is access to basic services. This has been something that Labor has never been afraid of spending obscene amounts of public money on for low return. The problem is that they still leave so much of the country behind because their focus has always been on how they use telecommunications as a mechanism for pork-barrelling rather than for improving the basic infrastructure that Australians need, with a sense of universal obligation. Members from rural and regional electorates can talk about that at length. I don't seek to project or represent their communities on those issues, but I know full well that it remains an ongoing problem, particularly with mobile telephony services. The member for Mallee, as I understand it, has previously raised issues where people are increasingly using Starlink installations because they can't get access to the services they need through the National Broadband Network. We also have, even in urban centres like the Goldstein electorate, massive problems around access to telecommunications services—basic things like mobile telephony. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got the state government basically seeking to weaponise housing approvals and development. I'm getting more and more complaints in places like Highett, Cheltenham and even Brighton, where people are having increasing problems accessing telecommunications services, including mobile telephony services and even television services. When it comes to basic standards and safeguards in telecommunications powers, this fits as part of the communications framework that people expect to see from our nation's parliament and our laws. Only the other day, I got a complaint about minimum access to services for mobile telephony in Brighton, with someone explicitly saying, 'Can we see more effort from Telstra to be able to access basic 4G and 5G services?' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same has also been increasingly true around Hampton East, Cheltenham and parts of Moorabbin. More and more people are working from home, but, because of an increasing number of developments of high-rise apartments and increasing disruptions from 5G access to internet connections, they're not getting the basic services and standards that they reasonably expect. So there's an accountability gap about the information they need—and, of course, they need more and more assistance, particularly where there are activity centres. It's not just that they're facing it now; they're concerned that it will fall on deaf ears into the future with this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People expect basic standards and basic services. That is not in dispute in telecommunications powers. But what they also expect is that the government is going to step up and meet those expectations, and they're not hearing it, they're not seeing it and they're living with the consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just read out a quote from a constituent only the other day: 'Despite strong community opposition, a development has since been amended to increase from the original plan to eight storeys, with additional apartments. This construction has created absolute chaos for residents—illegal parking, unsafe road conditions, but 5G disrupted internet disruptions, loss of free-to-air TV reception for residents opposite and numerous other impacts that council has been completely unprepared to manage.' Some of these sit within council and some sit within state government, but the one that sits within federal government responsibility is telecommunications powers. When we talk about safeguards and we talk about standards, this is the lived reality in urban Australia right now, and the government is completely asleep at the wheel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we support the legislation's broad intention, what it seeks to achieve, but we are mindful. We have seen too many times that members of previous Labor governments, when they're given powers around telecommunications, weaponise them with the objective of seeking to use them to censor or silence opinions or views that they don't like—not ones that are criminal but ones they don't like. They've tried to regulate the media and tried to censor and silence those who have differing opinions. We still remember that era of the Rudd government—and there are some people from the Rudd government who are still around—who got their blood pumping at the idea that they might be able to close down dissenting voices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have never really liked diversity, except their own diversity, which is from the Left to the far left. We want a full diversity of Australian voices, and that's by making sure systems remain open and making sure telecommunications powers have a limit to ensure there's standardisation and the Australian people flourish—that those powers are not used as a weapon to control Australians, as the Australian Labor Party has a sad, shameful history of doing because that is in their core. It is in their DNA and what they seek to do when they gain the treasury benches. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  This is the second time I've spoken on this bill, because it's one of those matters that we considered prior to the election, but it wasn't able to be dealt with by the parliament at that time. That's a shame, because this is about trying to bring in enhanced protections for consumers. I refer to the comment from, really, the peak communications consumer body, ACCAN, who have welcomed the fact that this bill is now being debated a second time—keeping in mind that it had passed through this place and it had landed in the Senate. As they say, it's time to finish the job of delivering long-awaited powers for the regulator to crack down on telcos that cause consumer harm. This is something that ACCAN and other consumer organisations have long called for. They wanted stronger powers and penalties to be available to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA. I note the comment of CEO of ACCAN, Carol Bennett:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legislation addresses persistent gaps that have left many consumers exposed to harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She is absolutely right. This is a bill that really plugs some of the gaps that have allowed consumers to be very vulnerable to actions or the lack of action by the telecommunications businesses, and it provides more teeth for ACMA to be able to tackle those. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of those things. We're talking about telecommunications, which is an absolutely essential connector that we all need. We need it for our families; when I was running a small business, I absolutely needed reliable telecommunications to run my business; and our communities need it, particularly when there are disasters. Goodness knows that my electorate of Macquarie—the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury—has experienced more than its fair share of natural disasters, where connectivity has absolutely been key. It isn't just during the crisis that it can be life saving to have connection; it's following the crisis, in the speed with which things are restored that can make such a difference. We know that Australians deserve of a telecommunications system that is fair, accountable and built on trust. Remember that most of our mobile phone and landlines—for those of us who still have a landline—and a big portion of our internet is privately owned and privately operated, underpinned by the NBN, a government-owned agency. All the mobile stuff we do is all in the private sector these days. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill equips the telecommunications industry regulator, ACMA, with the tools and powers that it desperately needs to protect consumers from poor and harmful telecommunications practices. Significantly there are very big increases in the penalties that can be applied. For instance, it increases by 40 times civil penalties that the Federal Court can issue for breaches of industry codes and industry standards. We're not just doubling something. We're not just boosting it a bit. What we're saying is that this needs to be much bigger—40 times larger. The cap is now up from $250,000 to nearly $10 million. It's a shame that we need to have such a big stick there to make the telcos do the right thing, but our conclusion is that we absolutely need to have much stronger powers and much greater capacity to act when they do the wrong thing. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also modernises the civil penalties framework so that the Federal Court has the option to issue fines for regulatory breaches. The fines can be $10 million or three times the benefit gained for the regulatory breach—so there's a very clear connection between the breach and the financial gain that the telco received, and the penalty will relate to that—or a fine of 30 per cent of turnover. These are much more significant penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also expands and clarifies the authority of the Minister for Communications to increase infringement notice penalties that ACMA can issue for breaches of industry codes, industry standards and service provider determinations. Another aspect of the bill is around establishing what we call a carriage service provider registration scheme. Right now, we don't necessarily know who all the carriage service providers are, and this is about increasing the visibility of the CSPs who operate in the market so that we can stop the operation of dodgy carriage service providers who pose an unacceptable risk to consumers. Registering them means we have visibility, which means we have the capacity to act much more effectively when issues arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing this bill does is make the telecommunications industry codes directly enforceable by ACMA. Really, the aim of that is to incentivise industry compliance and enable the regulator to take swift action to address consumer harm. These reforms will ensure that ACMA is an empowered and effective regulator and that appropriate structures are in place to drive better behaviour by telecommunications companies. This is not something that has just suddenly been needed; this has been needed for some time. I think every member of parliament here would have dealt with constituents who've had issues with telcos where those issues have not been adequately dealt with and addressed by the telecommunications provider. I would hope this entire parliament realises that this is urgent, and I hope the Senate realises that too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, the Albanese government has focused very heavily on lifting the standards for this sector. There has been a new industry standard requiring telecommunications companies to provide adequate support to consumers experiencing financial hardship. We've also had a new industry standard requiring telecommunications companies to support and assist consumers experiencing domestic, sexual and family violence, which came into force on 1 July, and I just want to share some of the details about that. The sorts of things that are in that standard, which can make such a difference to a woman and her children who are escaping family violence, are things that will require the telco providers to be involved, to stand up and act and to keep victims-survivors safe, including reversing disconnection, suspension and restriction of services when a domestic and family violence safety risk is raised by a customer. It will also ensure that they're only contacting people using agreed methods and that they're hiding sensitive information, like calls to 1800RESPECT, and preventing those things from appearing on bills. That can actually save lives. The changes we've made also ensure staff are appropriately trained to recognise and support victims-survivors. People need that, because you don't automatically know what to do when someone makes a disclosure, and that training of telco staff is really important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes also ensure that victims-survivors will never be asked to engaged with the alleged perpetrator to resolve their telco issues. Again, that's about dignity. That's about ensuring you're not exacerbating a situation. There are a number of measures to prevent victims-survivors from being retraumatised, by not having to repeat their story multiple times or provide extensive evidence of abuse. Then what follows that is giving customers a greater say in managing the security and privacy of their accounts. So I'm very pleased that the first tranche of that came into effect from 1 July. That new industry standard fits with this piece of legislation as one of several things we're doing to lift the standards and to make our telecommunications sector responsive to consumer needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area that we've focused on in telecommunications that aligns with the bill that we're discussing here today is in the changes to the Competition and Consumer Act, which we amended to introduce consistent obligations of the telecommunications banking and digital platform sectors to prevent, detect and disrupt scams. So we're not seeing the telecommunications sector in isolation from banking when it comes to scams. Many a time, people will find that it is a text message on their phone that can be the trigger for or the first attempt of a scam. It might be something on their social media. It might be an email. It's coming through a carriage service provider. It's coming to them, and, at every step of the scam process where scammers use social media, phone or email, where they then get people to dip into their banking, all those sectors have to be responsible for it, and that's what our legislation has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I referred earlier to ACCAN and its support for the changes that we are making today. I note that they've thanked the government for putting consumers first. In their view, the reforms better align telecommunications with other essential services like energy and banking by strengthening enforcement, lifting penalties and making industry codes enforceable. You can see the consistency of the approach that we're taking in this way. We're saying to the sectors, 'You all have shared responsibility here.' This bill, in particular, lifts those consumer standards so that they are consistent. I do note that ACCAN highlights that 'new powers are only as good as the regulator who wields them'. Like ACCAN, we fully expect ACMA to act quickly and transparently when providers fall short, and we are confident they will do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australians, we rely very heavily on phone and internet services every day. When something goes wrong, it does need to be dealt with quickly. Previously, there has been a gap in doing that. We recognise that there are a whole lot of things we need to do to expand the access to telecommunications. One of our policies—I think it's important to be reminded of this—is to have a universal outdoor mobile obligation on the telecommunications providers. That's going to require the mobile carriers to provide access to mobile voice and SMS almost everywhere in Australia. I'm particularly keen to see this because I represent an electorate that has mountains and valleys. It's got rugged, World Heritage terrain where it's easy to get lost and, if you do get lost, really hard to make a phone call.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The universal outdoor mobile obligation, the UOMO—it's very catchy—will ensure that up to five million square kilometres of new competitive outdoor mobile coverage will come into existence, including more than 37,000 kilometres on regional roads. It is so important for people travelling through the regions or living in the regions to have coverage as they drive. Whether it's in national parks, out on the farm or out in quite remote areas, outdoor coverage will be accessible almost anywhere where Australians can see the sky. Our objectives in doing this are to expand the triple 0 access for all Australians right across the nation. My community is only about 95 kilometres from Sydney, but this will potentially save lives because people travelling on very challenging roads where it is difficult to get a signal, like Bells Line of Road or Putty Road, will be able to call for help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will expand outdoor voice and SMS coverage into existing mobile black spots that are really challenging to tackle because of the geography. It will improve the availability of mobile signals during disasters and power outages. These are the sorts of things that we are prioritising, always putting consumers first. This bill looks at protections for consumers. We have separately looked at expanding access to services for consumers. We have got more protections for victims-survivors of domestic and family violence, and I am very proud to be part of a government that says the consumer comes first. The services exist to serve consumers, and how they are treated in the process is absolutely vital. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Janelle Ruggeri and Graeme Kruger just brought along to my office some very impressive young people: Nathan Crawley, Emily Marston, Sarah McCaskie, Thomas Hatty and Daniel Andreazza from Griffith and Tocumwal. They're not from my Riverina electorate per se, but they certainly are from the geographic area of Riverina. They are rice growers. You might wonder why I'm raising this—before I get a point of order on relevance from the minister at the table—as part of the debate on the Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025. Like the member for Macquarie, I appreciate that farming requires good telecommunications, and every place needs the very best telecommunications and the utmost safeguards for consumers. That is why the coalition supports this bill's second iteration. It has been enhanced by an amendment—an excellent one, at that—moved by the shadow minister for communications and shadow minister for women, the member for Lindsay. I acknowledge that she has put that forward, and I very much commend it to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These young rice growers, who are part of the Ricegrowers' Association of Australia's Next Generation Leadership Program, emphasised to me the importance of technology in what they do. They absolutely have to have the very best telecommunications as they do research into lowering emissions from their paddies and maximising every precious drop of water. They still call them paddies even though they're doing a flush method rather than a pond method on some of these modern rice farms these days out in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and in Coleambally. But they can't do their research, and they therefore can't be even more environmentally sustainable than they already are, unless they have good telecommunications to be able to pass on the data, the analytics, the knowledge and the updates. Then they can have it at one central point so that they can learn from their research and their farms can be more profitable, sustainable and progressive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really commend the work that each and every one of those young farmers are doing, because they are the future. It doesn't matter whether you're growing rice, or whether you are indeed growing any sort of food or fibre, you need to have the very best of telecommunications. What we're seeing these days is farmers using groundbreaking GPS technology on their tractors and equipment so that they stay in line, each and every bit of valuable soil is utilised to its maximum benefit and each and every valuable droplet of water is used to its maximum benefit. That only happens when you've got the very best of technology, the very best of global positioning systems technology and good mobile communications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Macquarie mentioned her electorate and the fact that the geography and topography of her electorate is wide and varied, which is very similar to the Riverina electorate that I now serve with the new alignment of boundaries of the Australian Electoral Commission, which came into effect at the May election this year. I've now retaken the Snowy Mountains, Kosciuszko and beyond. We've got hilly terrain. The high point of Australian politics is Kosciuszko. The mountaintop, the summit, is in the Riverina electorate. I'm very proud of that fact. The fact is that they are very prone to fires and very prone to having emergency situations. We need the best telecommunications to enable our emergency service workers to communicate, get help and save people's lives when things happen. If you think about it, at the moment, we've got Australia's largest manhunt happening in  Porepunkah in north-east Victoria, and they no doubt need good telecommunications, too, as they search for the killer of those two brave police officers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have a rollout of telecommunications in the bush, we need to be fair about it. I know many members have come in and talked about colour coded spreadsheets. The sad reality is that the colour coded spreadsheets for the telecommunications towers, in the first term of this government, were all red. They claimed that they were, as part of the rollout of towers, simply honouring election commitments. But they need to be fair about this when it comes to the spread of telecommunications towers, because everybody needs good telecommunications, not just Labor electorates. I would urge and encourage the new communications minister to consider that when they are funding those towers, which do not just provide convenience and data sharing but indeed save lives—they absolutely do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Macquarie also mentioned an important part of this telecommunications bill we are debating—domestic violence and scams. I do want to commend that aspect of this bill and the fact that, if there is a partner who is being subjected to domestic abuse, particular numbers will not show up on telephone bills. That's absolutely, vitally important. Anything that can be done to protect and safeguard particularly women in domestic violence situations is to be applauded and encouraged, obviously. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come to scams, I would urge and encourage people to avail themselves of a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Book of Scams</span>. It doesn't matter who's in government—I actually had the former member for Whitlam come to my electorate and run a very worthwhile scams seminar in Wagga Wagga, and he was fabulous. These days, the scammers are so professional and so adept at separating people from their money for their own graft and gain that it is quite remarkable. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Book of Scams</span> is good reading. It's sobering reading. It's actually helping people spot and avoid scams. And, when it comes to scams, telecommunications are the preferred method of choice by a lot of these people who would steal people's money. It's white-collar crime and it's on an industrial scale. These nefarious characters are coming in from overseas—they're operating from overseas bases. They're also very much operating right here at home. They prey on older people. They prey on vulnerable people. I would advise people to take heed of what the government says when it comes to text or SMS scams, email scams, phone scams and website scams. Money's hard enough to earn in this cost-of-living crisis. You don't want to be giving it up to somebody who is not earning it but just wants to separate you from your hard earned wealth. So I commend that particular publication to everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025 before us does create a register of carriage service providers. It does enable the direct enforcement of industry codes and increases the maximum penalty amount from a quarter of a million dollars to $10 million. That might seem a lot of money, and it is, but corporations have an obligation to do the right thing and to put in place the provisions, the measures and the personnel to ensure that customers are safeguarded—that the consumers who use their services are kept as much as possible away from those activities and those people who would otherwise do them harm. It also amends the existing two-step process for the application of penalty amounts for infringement notices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a visit to my parliamentary office yesterday by Chris Taylor and Christina Cawkell from Telstra, and it was good to get an update. I commend Mr Taylor for the work that he has done in my electorate, and others besides, to ensure that he keeps members of parliament and moreover—very much moreover—members of the public updated on what that big telco is doing when it comes to services. Ms Cawkell is looking after the shires I've just taken over—Snowy Valleys, Yass Valley and Upper Lachlan shires. She has others in her care as well. I respect the job that they're doing, and I emphasised again that there are still communities that are hurting from the changeover from 3G. I know Telstra very much acknowledges that and are working on it, but there are people—the member for Macquarie mentioned people on landlines—who are relying on their landlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, in my electorate, there are people out Ardlethan way, in Ariah Park, Beckom, Kamarah and that district, who have to climb up on top of their silos, would you believe, to get a signal. You could imagine climbing up a silo, with one hand on the ladder and one hand on your phone, just to get a signal. That might be to be able to sell your grain, to be able to get the best price for your stock or whatever the case might be, but it might also be to get an ambulance. When it comes to getting help for these little communities and these farmers who do so much for our nation, just trying to get an ambulance is an exercise in itself—let alone having to climb a silo to do it. We need to remember that and we need to reflect on that. Particularly when the Minister for Communications is designating funding for vital telecommunications upgrades, that is so very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new carriage service provider registration scheme is going to require all telecommunications providers to apply to the Australian Communications and Media Authority for registration to operate in Australia. It should have always been the minimum, quite frankly. This will provide ACMA, as the regulator for the sector, with visibility of all operators in the Australian market, of which there are an estimated 1,500 at the moment. It will ensure that ACMA is able to monitor, to educate and, where necessary, to take rapid enforcement action for any breaches of any codes or standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that this particular legislation passed through the House before. It lapsed, but it is good that it has been able to return. Should providers breach their obligations—or, indeed, pose a risk to consumers—ACMA would have the ability to cancel their registration to operate. This should be an absolute minimum in this day and age, because telecommunications are far too important to have people operating in the industry or the sector who could probably otherwise best be described as cowboys. People who are operating in this sector need to understand that there are minimum standards and that there are high fines now able to be imposed. They were high before; they've now very much got into the area of very severe, as they should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These arrangements are similar to those in the energy sector, where the Australian Energy Regulator has the power to forbid operators from operating in a market where there is risk to consumers. They can't determine the price of power, unfortunately, but they're able to do that. This telecommunication amendment is good legislation. It's worthwhile legislation, but I do commend to the House the amendment put forward by the member for Lindsay.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="312871" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TRISH COOK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bullwinkel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I rise today to speak on a matter which is critical to the lives of every single Australian, and it's a matter that goes directly to the heart of our government's values of fairness, accountability and trust. I am speaking in strong support of the Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025. Enhancing consumer safeguards—that's what it's all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal member for Bullwinkel, I represent an electorate that stretches from the periurban fringes of Perth to the wheat belt, where, every single day, our families, businesses and emergency services rely on telecommunications to function. In today's world, connectivity is not a luxury; it's the lifeblood of our communities. It supports our kids' education, it enables small businesses to trade, and it connects us with our loved ones, especially in times of crisis. Australians deserve a telecommunications system that is fair, accountable and, most of all, trustworthy. For too long there have been many poor practices in the industry. This bill changes that. It's a comprehensive package of reforms that will equip the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, with the modern, effective tools it needs to protect Australian consumers from poor and harmful practices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The core of this bill can be distilled into three key reforms, and I wish to speak to each of them today. The first reform is that we are increasing maximum civil penalties. In the current framework, the maximum civil penalty for a serious breach of industry codes and standards is $250,000. For a multinational corporation generating billions of dollars in revenue, a quarter-of-a-million-dollar fine is simply a slap on the wrist. It is, as my colleagues have also said, simply a cost of doing business. It is an amount that does not deter harmful practices. It sends a message that it's more profitable to break the rules and pay the fine than it is to do the right thing by your customers. This is fundamentally wrong, and it erodes the trust that Australians place in their service providers. This bill dramatically changes that. It amends the Telecommunications Act to increase the maximum general civil penalty for breaches of industrial codes and standards to 30,300 penalty units, which, at the time of drafting, is just shy of $10 million. This is a 40-fold increase in penalties—a powerful statement that this government is serious about consumer protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> But we go even further. The bill modernises the penalty framework to give the flexibility for fines to be based on the benefit gained from such conduct—up to 30 per cent of the relevant provider's turnover. This means that, for a company with a very high turnover, the penalty can and should be significantly more than $10 million. This penalty framework aligns our telecommunications sector with standards that we see in other industries, like energy and banking, as well as the Australian Consumer Law. This is about creating a level playing field, where the penalty for the breach is truly proportionate to the harm caused and where no company, no matter how large, can treat consumer protection as an optional extra. It ensures that the Federal Court can impose a penalty that is a genuine deterrent. Effectively, it strongly encourages companies to prioritise ethical conduct over a quick profit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second crucial reform of this bill is the establishment of a carriage service provider, or CSP, registration scheme. This was a longstanding issue for the previous Labor and coalition governments, and this lack of visibility is a black hole for regulators. The limited visibility of the carriage service provider has hampered ACMA's ability to actively educate providers on their obligations and to target compliance efforts. This bill changes that. By establishing a CSP registration scheme, we will increase the visibility of the market and give ACMA and other government agencies the ability to streamline complaints and compliance processes. It will provide a clear line of sight, ensuring that every provider is known and accountable. This means that dodgy providers will no longer be able to operate in the shadows, preying on consumers without being held to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also introduces a powerful deterrent. ACMA will be empowered to stop CSPs from operating in the market if they pose an unacceptable risk to consumers or cause significant consumer harm. This power will be used as a last resort, with suitable checks and balances in place, but it provides the regulator with the necessary authority to protect consumers from the worst actors in the industry. It means consumers can have greater confidence in the providers that they choose, knowing there is a system in place to ensure that they are held to account. This is a reform that will incentivise better behaviour and weed out those that are doing the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This may sound like a technical change, but in fact the impact is profound. Under the current legislation, even if a telco is caught red-handed breaching a code, no matter how egregious the breach, ACMA can only issue a direction for them to comply with the code. It is only if the provider then fails to follow that direction that ACMA can take stronger enforcement action. This bill removes that clunky and time-consuming two-step process. It makes compliance with these codes mandatory from the moment they are registered. This gives ACMA the ability to take immediate and decisive enforcement action, providing a stronger incentive for industry compliance and ensuring that consumers are protected without delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not standalone measures. The bill is a vital piece of our government's broader consumer protection agenda. Since coming to office, we have already introduced new industry standards to support consumers experiencing financial hardship, and we just saw recently the implementation of a new standard that requires telecommunications companies to support and assist consumers experiencing domestic, sexual and family violence. We also amended the Competition and Consumer Act earlier this year to introduce consistent obligations on telcos, banks and digital platforms to prevent and disrupt scams. This bill is a crucial pillar in that ongoing work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Bullwinkel, I know the important of connectivity, not just for consumer protection but for the economic and social wellbeing of our community. This is why the Albanese Labor government is also delivering historic investment in regional connectivity. A large part of my seat is considered regional. The $55 million Mobile Black Spot Program, which had applications close this April, will provide resilient mobile coverage in disaster-prone areas, and certainly Bullwinkel is a disaster-prone area with regard to bushfires. The $50 million Regional Roads Australia Mobile Program pilot programs, which also include an $8 million allocation for Western Australia, will test new solutions to increase mobile coverage on our regional highways and major roads, improving safety and connection. And, of course, round 3 of the Regional Connectivity Program awarded just over $115 million towards 74 projects, which also included a dedicated Central Australia stream to improve connectivity for First Nations communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a testament to the Albanese Labor government's commitment to a fair, accountable and trusted telecommunications system. It is a win for consumers, a win for integrity and a win for a more connected Australia. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248895" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PENFOLD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  The Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025 makes changes to the Telecommunications Act to strengthen consumer safeguards, something we should all agree is a top priority. The bill will create a register of carriage service providers, enable the direct enforcement of industry codes, amend the existing two-step process for the application of penalty amounts for infringement notices, and increase the maximum penalty amount for breaches of the codes from $250,000 to $10 million. Full visibility of all telecommunications operators will also ensure ACMA can target compliance and enforcement activities and, where necessary, take appropriate action. The changes in this bill will strengthen ACMA's powers and the speed at which they can use them, to provide even greater protections for consumers and ensure we have responsible operators in our telecommunications sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important step towards holding the telcos to account to industry standards, but I think what is missing from this legislation is a consideration of the standards themselves. As they currently stand, the bar is too low. We need to reassess the universal service obligation. The USO is the obligation for Telstra to ensure that standard telephone services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business, and to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. Rather than being maintained or improved, the quality of landline phone infrastructure is noticeably deteriorating, especially in rural areas of the electorate. In times of emergency, the consequence can be life threatening. Not only is Telstra failing in its universal service obligation of providing reasonable standard telephone services via landline phone connection, but it is also failing to provide a reliable and cost-effective alternative. Many people are forced to go to the more expensive Starlink satellite in the hope that it will prove to be reliable. This government must negotiate new terms that better reflect advances in technology. Telstra and, indeed, all providers need to be held to account and made to uphold these new universal service obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does nothing to improve mobile and internet services in my electorate, which has poor to non-existent mobile and internet service—one of the biggest issues, next to roads and health, that is consistently raised with me. Mobile and internet service is becoming increasingly unreliable in many locations across my electorate. Frustratingly, the service is worse now than it was just a few years ago. In rural areas of the electorate, loss of internet and mobile service for extended periods is becoming increasingly common. I'll give you an example. Residents within the town of Marlee have gone weeks and, on one occasion, well over a month without any mobile or landline service. In coastal areas of my electorate that experience a seasonal influx in tourist numbers, like Forster, Tuncurry and Harrington, internet either operates at snail's pace or simply drops out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can give you an example from Harrington. A butcher there, only a Christmas ago, could not service any of his customers. His Square just simply could not work, because this small town—I know many of the MPs here, who often holiday in my electorate, would know that the population of Harrington can triple in a holiday season, but the bandwidth can't cope with the additional people and the 30 per cent natural increase in the use of data. Businesses in this town of Harrington—it's the busy time; it's when they're planning to hopefully make a bit of cash—simply cannot run their business unless people have cash in their wallet. This is a huge issue for small businesses in towns like Harrington and many of my other coastal communities. It's simply not good enough in a society that's increasingly forced to become reliant on technology. People in Nabiac struggle to access their online prescriptions. Pensioners are unable to access their myGov account. Hotels and restaurants are unable to take bookings online. People are unable to make medical appointments or receive reminders. They're unable to contact family and friends, and they're unable to contact emergency services in times of dire need. I've got a number of communities that are a single road in and a single road out—places like Pindimar and Bundabah and places like Pacific Palms that are surrounded by forest, and there is no escape. Having an internet or phone service that actually works when you need it is critical to them surviving in those difficult circumstances.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to use an example from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gloucester District News of the Area</span> of a town called Barrington on the Thunderbolts Way on the other side of Gloucester. I'll just read the first bit because I want to put this on the record:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">According to Telstra's Network Coverage Map the whole village of Barrington is covered by its mobile service, and there is nothing to indicate that Barrington residents are likely to experience issues using their mobile phones.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, a gentleman—his name is Todd Barnes from Pappinbarra—who'd returned from South Africa emailed me and told me his story. He said:</span>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's on the Pacific Highway, our national highway. He went on to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not good when Australia is supposed to be a first world country … The local African guys can't believe we can't drive between towns on a highway and not have mobile service. They thought I was pulling their chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, are we being left behind in the regions? Why are we being left behind in the regions? I understand that geography plays a part, and I understand the geography in my electorate, but surely a modern Australia that cares about the regions can find a way to ensure that all Australians have access to mobile and internet services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk now about the poor assistance that many of my constituents have when they try to deal with telcos. I just want to remind the House that the Lyne electorate is in fact the oldest electorate of all here, so my constituents are particularly challenged by technology. Many of them have not grown up with it. They've come to have to use a mobile phone as much older people. Indeed, I know it is my own experience. I'm going to say that the first time I ever used email was when working in the minister for industrial relations's office in 1996. I remember the computer lab going in at school. I'm 54, and even I find the challenge sometimes difficult. I, myself, have come to it later in life, but I appreciate that, for much older Australians, it's more difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constituents also report a very poor customer service experience when reporting issues to the telcos' call centres. They are firstly met with an extremely long wait time for either in-store visits or calls to the call centre, and then they are faced with a person on the other end having no understanding, appreciation or empathy for the situation or for the client. My constituents have informed me of numerous instances where a maintenance person scheduled to attend their property to fix the issue cancelled at the last minute. No-shows are a common experience, as are technicians failing to first confirm with the business or household that the scheduled time is acceptable. Better training is certainly required. I have to say I have raised this directly with the telcos. I have spoken even with the stores in my own electorate and the staff there to raise the issues of ensuring that the staff are trained, first of all, to be responsive and communicate and also to make sure that they understand who they're talking to and really try to help them. I do give credit to successive governments, also, for investing in the regional tech hub because that has also been a great source of support for many people in regional Australia, particularly farmers and older Australians, to go and get one-on-one support try—as I often say—to unscramble the bureaucracy and technology to try and make it work for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to fee-for-no-service, there are also numerous examples of telcos charging fees for either no service or substandard service. If a customer experiences a loss of service for a substantial period of time, providers do not credit the customer unless the customer makes a request. Even then, they may not get a full credit refund for the time the service was not provided, or if only a substandard service was provided. What other business could get away with charging a customer when they have not received a service in return?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providers are failing to meet the customer service guarantee standard and are failing to proactively pay compensation if they are unable to meet timelines to fix landline services. I am looking forward to the telcos reporting on the levels of compensation that they provided to many of my constituents affected by the May floods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the oldest electorate in the country, many of my constituents lack the skills and tech-savviness to be able to navigate jargon and technology. One of my constituents, John, a 92-year-old still living at home in Allynbrook, was sold a brand-new mobile phone. He was told that it would finally enable him to make calls. It has not. John and his wife must still rely on their fading landline. I've seen constituents encouraged to disconnect their landline but, when the mobile does not work satisfactorily, they are then charged a $250 landline reconnection fee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is one of the issues, because the expectations of consumers are very different to the technical expertise of those selling the equipment. I know that the expectation of many consumers and many people in my electorate is that—when they know their landlines are failing and the copper technology is pretty much done and dusted—when they buy a mobile phone, sign up to a contract and give their home address, when they agree, the telco acknowledges that that service works at their house. I can't tell you the number of times that I've had constituents come to me, saying: 'I've been sold a phone. I bought it; I signed the contract thinking it would work at home, but it doesn't work at home.' But, then, Telstra, Optus or whoever it is, say: 'We don't guarantee. We will not guarantee that your service will work at home. It's a mobile phone; it's meant to work when you're roaming.' The expectations of the customer and the delivery by the telcos are not aligned, and that is a serious issue, particularly for older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak to some of the funding which, sadly, we are not seeing in the electorate. The Mobile Black Spot Program has not been extended beyond 2026-27, with zero dollars allocated. Furthermore, the government has not allocated any funding in 2027-28 to the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia. Like the Mobile Black Spot Program, there is no funding for these programs beyond 2026-27. There has been no announcement on another round for the Mobile Network Hardening Program. This funding is critical and important. The government needs to be supporting sensible policies that facilitate arrangements to ensure that the telecommunications infrastructure framework supports efficient, effective and equitable mobile telecommunications network delivery across Australia, including in rural and remote areas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="316101" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLUTTERHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  It's fair to say that, without telecommunications connectivity, living life would be very difficult. Telecommunications connectivity is required to participate in family and personal life, in education, in sport, in business and, importantly, in the community. Therefore, no matter where you live, connection is fundamental. Because of the widespread role telecommunications connectivity plays for all of us, a system that is fair, accountable and built on trust is critical for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Communications and Media Authority is the regulator of this sector, acting to regulate communications and media with the purpose of maximising the economic and social benefits that communications infrastructure, services and content bring to all Australians. The authority of ACMA is the authority that makes decisions on matters of importance for ACMA, including with respect to telecommunications consumer issues. Covering the internet, telephones, TV, radio and content, spectrum and equipment compliance, the Australian Communications and Media Authority sets and manages rules about communications, media services and markets. It provides licences for people, organisations and products to operate in Australia. It plans and manages the airwaves to make space for new services and technology, such as 5G, and it also considers complaints and problems and takes action when rules are not being followed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These complaints and problems may relate to a number of different areas—firstly, broadcasting compliance and investigations, which are investigations into TV, radio and online content, and the rules about what broadcasters can show on TV and radio. Secondly, ACMA considers telemarketing and scam compliance and investigations, which, in very broad terms, relate to breaches of the law as they concern the sending of marketing emails or messages. Thirdly, with respect to radiocommunications and telecommunications compliance and investigations, ACMA investigates licensing, interference management, device supply arrangements, customer equipment and cabling compliance, media control and ownership compliance, and other investigations which also form part of ACMA's remit, which means, in broad terms, that ACMA has the power to require rectification in circumstances of breaches of statutory control, media diversity or directorship rules. These investigations may require the production of documents, the examination of witnesses or the holding of public hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, ACMA also accepts enforceable undertakings under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Spam Act 2003, the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014. Then it issues infringement notices under several pieces of legislation, including the Do Not Call Register Act 2006, the Spam Act, the Telecommunications Act, the Broadcasting Services Act and telecommunications and radiocommunications regulations. The remit is extremely large, and this regime is designed with the purpose of facilitating compliance with these important pieces of legislation and regulations because they regulate telecommunications connectivity, which all Australians need and which must be fair, trustworthy and accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The types of infringement notices ACMA has issued include where organisations have failed to undertake adequate identity checks when porting consumers' mobile numbers from other telecommunications companies. They also include where providers have sent marketing emails and SMSs without consent and without a functional unsubscribe facility and where they have failed to confirm that a person requesting a high-risk customer transaction was in fact the customer or the customer's authorised representative, in that there was a failure to use an applicable identity authentication process prior to undertaking the high-risk transaction. There have also been infringement notices where organisations have failed to comply with billing accuracy rules as set out in the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code by not being able to provide, verify and demonstrate accuracy of bills to customers. There can be no reasonable argument against the proposition that Australians deserve for these types of infringements to be investigated, called out and then rectified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, ACMA's remit also includes telecommunications compliance and investigations, the premise of which is that telecommunications companies must follow certain laws when delivering mobile, landline, internet and NBN services to the Australian public. These laws cover matters including the details and words that advertisements must and must not contain and how telecommunications companies must handle complaints when complaints are made to them. They include rules about customer identity authentication, rules about assisting law enforcement and security agencies with their work and rules for priority assistance services which relate to landline services for people with life-threatening medical conditions. Telecommunications companies providing these services must meet the rules for the faster repairing of faults and the timeframes for connection of new services and must make arrangements for more reliable service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to consumer protections, ACMA also takes action in relation to telecommunications to ensure that companies that are delivering mobile, landline and internet services follow laws that are applicable to them and that are directly relevant to the protection of consumers. In carrying out this function, ACMA collects information, consults about issues related to compliance and then assesses the level of risk. More specifically, in doing this, ACMA consults with consumer interest groups; analyses industry complaints data; commissions studies and publishes reports about telecommunications safeguards or the telecommunications consumer experience; provides compliance information to industry; undertakes compliance assessment; investigates serious, repeated and systemic noncompliance, which could be referred to ACMA by external parties or identified by ACMA itself; and takes enforcement action where warranted. Australians need and deserve for ACMA to have this remit so that they are protected when utilising essential telecommunications services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where we get to this bill. It is so important, in that it will equip the telecommunications industry regulator with the tools and powers it needs to protect Australian consumers and to carry out its remit so Australian consumers do not fall foul of poor and harmful telecommunications practices. Some of the measures this bill proposes include increasing the quantum of civil penalties that can be issued by the Federal Court for breaches of industry codes and standards. This is being increased by 40 times, from $250,000 to nearly $10 million, because bigger deterrents are needed. The bill also modernises the civil penalties framework to give the Federal Court options in relation to issuing fines for regulatory breaches. This can include three times the benefit gained from the regulatory breach, $10 million or 30 per cent of organisation turnover. Currently, the civil penalties for breaches of industry codes and standards are not a deterrent. They are not commensurate with the harm caused. They are not high enough to deter noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will also modernise the penalty framework for industry codes, industry standards and service provider determination to allow for penalties based on the value of the benefit obtained from the non-compliant conduct. This penalty framework better aligns with those in other relevant sectors like energy and banking and, under the Australian Consumer Law, more adequately reflects the telecommunications market and, in fairness, the varying sizes of the entities engaged in the market, which range from small to medium businesses to very large corporations. This is an appropriately described discretionary option for the Federal Court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also establishes a carriage service provider registration scheme to increase visibility of carriage service providers operating in the market and stop the operation of unprincipled CSPs, who pose an unacceptable risk to consumers or cause significant harm. The amendments to the Telecommunications Act of 1997 will empower ACMA to stop CSPs who do pose this unacceptable risk from operating in the market. This will provide a further deterrent for significant noncompliance and will increase consumer trust in registered CSPs, including new or smaller CSPs. Importantly, ACMA's power to exclude CSPs from the market is expected to be used as a measure of last resort only, with suitable arrangements for the review of a decision, re-registration avenues and, critically, the maintenance of connectivity for impacted consumers, because we know that connectivity that is as uninterrupted as possible is necessary for everyone. This reform means that carriage service providers that are doing the wrong thing will face consequences and that consumers will be better protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this bill also makes telecommunications industry codes directly enforceable by ACMA, incentivising industry compliance and enabling ACMA to take swift action to address consumer harm. Currently, it cannot take direct enforcement action for breaches of the industry codes it has registered under part 6 of the Telecommunications Act, no matter how egregious the breach is, because, under this act, compliance with industry codes is initially technically voluntary. Part 6 of the act prescribes that bodies and associations representing sectors of the telecommunication industry may develop industry codes, that industry codes may be registered by ACMA and that compliance with an industry code is voluntary unless ACMA directs a particular participant to so comply. So, currently, if a breach is found, ACMA can either direct a provider to comply with the code or issue a formal warning. The bill introduces amendments to part 6 of the Telecommunications Act to make compliance mandatory, which removes the need for ACMA to direct a particular participant to comply with the code in the first instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also builds on the work that the Albanese government has delivered since coming to office in 2022, including a new industry standard requiring telecommunications companies to support and assist consumers experiencing domestic, sexual and family violence. This bill is designed to increase levels of public trust in Australia's telecommunications system by further empowering the regulator to take meaningful action in relation to specific and clearly defined instances of noncompliance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I support the Telecommunications Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2025 because I believe it can make a positive contribution towards holding telecommunications companies to account, and I think that aspect of it is supported. But I come from country Australia, and, in the Central West of New South Wales, mobile phone coverage is not what it should be. It is a serious problem for many of our local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get many, many pieces of correspondence, phone calls and emails from our local constituents, who are very concerned about the state of mobile coverage, and my concern is that the Mobile Black Spot Program, which the Australian government has operated for a long time, is no longer fit for purpose, because it's not clearing up all of these black spots. I'll return to that in a moment. Here are just a few examples of some of the constituents who've written in to me to raise issues about poor coverage. Geoff has written in about poor mobile coverage at Mookerawa, not far from Stuart Town. Ross has written in about poor mobile phone coverage at Marrangaroo, which is near Lithgow. Ines raises coverage issues at Frog Rock and is very upset about what's happening there. It's poor coverage; it's not where it should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ralph has written in about the lack of mobile coverage around Oberon. It is a serious problem around Oberon, especially around the Shooters Hill area and around Black Springs. I'm going to return to Black Springs in a moment. Judie out at Spicers Creek has issues with mobile connectivity out there. Ralph from Lyndhurst—again, there are serious issues of poor mobile service and reception around there. Then we have people like Julian, who's written in about the poor mobile coverage between Oberon and Bathurst. There are 'several blackspots on Telstra 4G', he writes, and he also points to areas like Wisemans Creek, Carlwood Road towards O'Connell and the area around the railway track in Rydal—and Rydal station itself. The coverage is not what it should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dave from Arkell, in our area, has written in, and he says there's been a problem with phone reception since 3G was turned off. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">we used to have quite good reception until last October. Now reception is getting much worse even with a booster in the house. Essentially no reception most of the time or call last for maybe one minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have contacted Telstra many times and got the big run around. they want to ring me back all the time and when we dont answer they cancel the whole complaint process. Well if we havent got reception how can we answer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is very frustrating … and means we have to go by car to another location to simply make a phone call.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">How can we make some progress on improving this situation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from David Rickards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clint Anderson writes about issues of connectivity and mobile reception around Lower Lewis Ponds and in the Banjo Paterson Way area. Chris from Rylstone—around Narrango Road in Rylstone—has complained to Telstra about poor reception since the 3G shutdown and, unfortunately, did not get the answers that he was looking for and that we were all looking for from Telstra. That's why I believe that the Mobile Black Spot Program really does need an overhaul. I think it's fair to say that the telcos have picked all of the low-hanging fruit from this program—that is, they put in bids for the locations from which they can make the most money. But all of those locations have now been taken, and their interest in this program is clearly waning. We're not getting the results from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a good example of this issue we've been having for a number of years at the village of Black Springs, which is not too far from Oberon. Telstra put in a bid a number of years ago for a small-cell tower to be placed at Black Springs, but, since then, it seems to me and the community that Telstra has been doing its level best to back out of actually delivering a small-cell tower at that site. We've had many, many conversations with the local community members and successive mayors of the local council out at Oberon, and I have to say we have been deeply unimpressed with the way that Telstra has handled this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra really needs to have a good look at the way that they are operating their community relations, because in the way this has come about there has been delay after delay. Every time a solution is brought to Telstra to address the reason that they say this tower can't be put there, another excuse is found. Now Oberon Council have come up with another location, which is opposite the location where Telstra originally wanted to set up the tower, and, again, Telstra are delaying actually getting a small-cell tower for the people of Black Springs. It is very, very frustrating for Mayor Andrew McKibbin and the team at Oberon Council, and it's very frustrating for me, because this saga has dragged on for far too long. But it highlights the problems that we are having with this program and with getting telcos to commit not only to honouring their commitments but to continuing to deliver for country communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another good example is Shooters Hill, not too far from Black Springs, where the community has been fighting for mobile coverage for a long, long time. So I say to Telstra: you've really got to have a look at the way you're operating in these communities, because you're not winning any friends out there. A lot of us have misgivings about the way Black Springs has been handled. It does Telstra no credit. I urge the minister to have a look at the way the Mobile Black Spot Program funding is being rolled out. It needs to be made a lot more effective. Right around the Calare electorate, we have black spot after black spot everywhere you go, from places like the Castlereagh Highway between Lithgow and Mudgee to the Mitchell Highway heading into western NSW. From our larger communities to our smaller ones, mobile black spots abound.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mobile connectivity is an essential service. We need it for business, for tourism, for emergencies and to keep our communities connected. Government has a really important role to play here, and our communities should not be forgotten. This is a fundamental issue of fairness and equality between city and country. City people take these services for granted. They forget that there are people out in the bush who are making extraordinary contributions to the wealth and prosperity of this country that are being overlooked for mobile connectivity. It's not fair, it's not right, and it must be brought to a close. The way the government could do it would be to make the Mobile Black Spot Program a lot more effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to have a really good, hard look at the program so that it better serves the needs of country Australia and the communities of central western NSW. I know I speak for everyone in our part of the world where we demand proper access to mobile phone service and mobile connectivity. We're not getting that at the moment. You can put a lot of the blame at the feet of the telcos, but the government also has a very important role to play and, when programs are not effective enough, they need to be overhauled so that they serve the interests of our country communities. We demand nothing less.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is continuing to deliver generational aged-care reforms. This amending legislation before the House will get the system ready for the Albanese government's once-in-a-generation reforms to our aged-care system. The legislation paves the way for a smooth transition to the new Aged Care Act, making sure the new Support at Home program and strengthened aged-care quality standards operate effectively. Paired with the new act, the legislation continues our work, delivering 58 recommendations of the royal commission to create a fairer system that puts older Australians at the centre of their care. This latest step will give providers more clarity to prepare clients, support workers and ready systems for the act's historic changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consulted with older people, their families and carers, providers, workers, peak bodies, union representatives, health professionals, academics and aged-care advocates every step of the way on these aged-care reforms. We've engaged in positive constructive negotiations with the opposition over this sitting period, and we are grateful for their genuine desire to help us build a better aged-care system. Our government is getting on with the job of delivering generational change to make sure that every older Australian can live with the best care, dignity and support. The passage of this bill brings the reform process one step closer. We're one step closer to bringing the key recommendation of the royal commission to fruition with a new rights based aged-care act that delivers the dignified care that older Australians deserve.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I'm quite sad that I'm having to stand here and speak on this Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2025; it shouldn't haven't gotten to this stage. I'm sad for those we have to protect. The No. 1 role of any government is to protect its citizens—our youngest citizens, those that are working so hard throughout their lives and into retirement, and our oldest citizens who need the greatest care; it is what they deserve. Unfortunately for 108,000 older Australians, they haven't got the care that they deserved. They have been on the waitlist, waiting while this government drags its feet, waiting while this government removes the promise it made prior to the election that there will be aged care in their homes. Any person who has older parents, all of us in here, know what I'm saying. They have grandparents or parents going through this. This is real-life stuff. This isn't just about parliamentarians making decisions in this place; it's about parliamentarians making decisions for the good of our country, and there is no greater good than protecting those who have done so much throughout their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We dragged the government through the House, through the Senate, through the public sphere, through the media, to finally make a decision that 20,000 places will be released now. There are 108,000 on the waitlist, and 20,000 released now. Because of the pressure, another 20,000 will be released by the end of the year and 43,000 by the end of the financial year, in line with a promise this government made prior to the election—a promise this government made to every Australian family, to our older Australians, to families looking after parents and grandparents. I can just imagine the dismay people are feeling across our country right now that it had to get to this. It has had to get to the government being embarrassed in public to release these places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard personal stories and anecdotes. The member for Mayo got up in tears and told the story of how she held a gentleman's hand in her electorate before she passed. The gentleman shouldn't have been in that position. He should have had that place. He should have had that package, but he didn't. He waited. Then he passed away. You can't want to be a parliamentarian that serves your community without feeling really deeply the hurt for so many thousands of Australians that have had to go through this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pleased—I don't know if 'pleased' is the word or if 'satisfied' is even the word. We accept that we are now in this position where the government has relented and agreed, through huge pressure that we've given on behalf of the Australian people, to make these amendments, to approve them, to bring them back here. It's an historic amendment for this parliament. It's a testament that, even though we may be small in opposition, every single member of parliament here is loud in the support that we have for our people right across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again I say, as we have this win for Australians, it is with sadness that we have had to get to this place. We stood up for older Australians across this country when the Albanese Labor government abandoned them. This situation should never have happened. The money was in the budget. The capacity was there. It is only Labor that stood in the way. It is a black mark on the government that they were purposely withholding support from hundreds of thousands of older Australians who have given so much—hundreds of thousands of older Australians who desperately needed it. Quite frankly, people were dying while they waited—5,000 in the past year alone. This is a crisis of the government's own making, and we on this side will continue to fight for every single Australian.</span>

Today I call on this place to back amendments to the Bankruptcy Act to prevent convicted paedophiles and other serious criminals from escaping justice by avoiding civil judgement debts through declaring bankruptcy. This issue has been brought to my attention by a constituent, Mrs Carolyn Kelly, the grandmother of Edan van Haren. Edan was a victim of Maurice Van Ryn, who was sentenced to imprisonment in 2019 in relation to child sexual abuse offences against Mr van Haren and other children. Mr van Haren, in a civil judgement, was awarded a debt of $1.4 million by the New South Wales Supreme Court in July 2023. But Van Ryn, a corporate accountant, hid his money and later declared bankruptcy. Unless the act is amended, Mr Van Ryn will escape his debt.</span>

This principle needs to be extended to judgement debts for serious criminal offences, including child sexual abuse. It's a simple amendment to section 153 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. I've written to the government, the minister, the Treasurer and the Attorney-General, requesting their support and action, and asked that the amendment be known as Edan's law to recognise Edan's— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

My partner, Jo, lost her father to brain cancer, and we wanted to contribute to the cause. The guest speaker that night was a remarkable professor, Richard Scolyer, former Australian of the Year. That night his message was simple: Australia needs to invest more in brain cancer research. Historically, this work has been underfunded because, tragically, patients aren't alive long enough to be advocates for themselves. Richard Scolyer has been that advocate. </span>

This funding will support a professorial chair, postdoctoral fellows, research assistants and scholarships. It will expand clinical trials, accelerate research and help translate discoveries into better patient outcomes. Importantly, this will acknowledge the incredible work that Richard Scolyer has done and all those before him who have fought for brain cancer research to be properly funded. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Alan Lucas was a titan of the local real estate fraternity; a man of faith, conviction and generosity; and one of the Redlands' most beloved sons. He gave his time, his energy and his financial support to countless causes across my city. He was the driving force behind the Redlands Easter Family Festival, which brought tens of thousands together to celebrate. He also founded the Redlands Christian Business Network, a fellowship that united men and women of faith to support one another and share the gospel in the marketplace. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan also spoke of the Redlands as being 'the great Redlands of the Holy Spirit', and he meant it. His was an inspirational faith. For him, belief was never private or hidden. He was an evangeliser who wanted others to know the joy and freedom that comes from walking with Christ. Alan had a rare gift for seeing the best in people. For those of us striving to make a difference in our community, he was always ready with his time, advice, encouragement and, above all, his prayers. Many, including myself, relied on him as a constant source of encouragement. He was a true believer, a man of conviction, a man with a tremendous generosity of spirit, a man who never wavered in his faith and, to many, a true friend. On behalf of the people of the Redlands, I want to extend my deepest condolences to Alan's wife, Janice, his children and his family. Alan was an inspiration to all who knew him. Vale, Alan Lucas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  Since the election held in May, the Albanese Labor government has been committed to delivering its promise on building Australia's future. During the 48th Parliament's first four weeks the contrast could not be clearer. Liberals are fighting Liberals, Nationals are fighting Nationals, and the Libs and Nats are having a crack at each other. Labor, meanwhile, are focused on building Australia's future by delivering on our election commitments to tackle the cost of living and to strengthen Medicare. One way we're helping Australians with the cost of living is through cheaper medicines. From 1 January 2026, the Albanese Labor government is expanding that further by making cheaper medicines even cheaper. Earlier this week, we passed legislation that would mean a prescription on the PBS would cost Australians no more than $25. The last time PBS medicines cost no more than $25 was in 2004, 21 years ago. Back in 2004, I was mum to my toddler son, three-year-old Clancy, and had just become mum for the second time to my youngest, Lily. I was on maternity leave, sleep deprived with hair like a bird's nest and wearing tracky dacks day after day and loving every minute of it. Cheaper medicines are another key cost-of living relief measure delivered by this government that I know will help ease the financial stress of constituents in my community of Aston who rely on these vital medications every single day. While those opposite are busy infighting, we're busy out fighting for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Right now, on Bondi Beach in my electorate of Wentworth, something both exciting and exhausting is happening: the Tama Touch football group are attempting a world record for the longest continuous touch rugby match in history—34 hours of non-stop play. As of now, they've been playing for 31 hours and 37 minutes. This group of mates have been playing on the beach for 20 years. Their extraordinary attempt is about more than just sport; it's about raising awareness for mental health. With Beyond Blue as a charity partner, Tama Touch footy have already raised over $156,000 to support the vital work of this organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing mental health has never been more urgent. The World Health Organization predicts depression will be the leading global health concern by 2030, and we see the impact of this challenge in every community, including mine in Wentworth. What Tama Touch footy are doing shows the very best of community spirit, looking out there for one another and taking action to help. Their effort would not be possible without the support of long-suffering families, friends, sponsors and Waverley Council. I want to pay tribute not just to the players but to everyone who has contributed to this extraordinary undertaking. I really wanted to be there to cheer them on, but I couldn't be, because parliament is sitting. I was very proud to play with them last Friday, and—my God—it was very tiring, even for five minutes! So I don't know how they will keep it up. But congratulations to Tama Touch footy for this inspiring effort to raise funds and awareness for mental health.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  This year, we celebrate 50 years of the incredible work that the Multicultural Communities Council of Illawarra have done bringing people together. MCCI, from 1975 with nine visionary community leaders gathering to give migrants a voice, has grown into one of our region's most respected organisations. From those humble beginnings, MCCI has played a central role in our community, supporting people from CALD backgrounds right across the Illawarra, the Shoalhaven and now the ACT and Queanbeyan. Over the past five decades, MCCI has provided essential services in aged care, youth programs, community development, cultural training and settlement support. They have been there for new arrivals, strongly supported by the Albanese Labor government with $321,000 through the Strong and Resilient Communities Activity and more than $4 million to deliver the Settlement Engagement and Transition Support program. During the election, I also secured a $5 million commitment to establish a new regional multicultural community centre in the Illawarra, and I look forward to delivering on that commitment. With around 300 staff and volunteers, speaking more than 50 languages, MCCI proudly reflects the diversity and strength of our community. On this golden anniversary, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to CEO, Chris Lacey; Chair, Ken Habak OAM; the board; and every staff member and volunteer, past and present, who have— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I'd like to talk about the special dinner that we had at the Macclesfield RSL last Saturday night. It was a dinner to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which happened on 2 September 1945. Everyone was dressed to the nines or, you could say, dressed to 1945! There were kilts. There were victory rolls in hair. It was a fantastic night. We had the Army band serenading us, and many of us danced. In fact, the RSL even organised dance lessons for people so that people could feel confident getting on the floor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the president of the Macclesfield RSL, Dennis Oldenhove, and his wife, Kaye. Bev Slack, who is a member of the RSL, organised all of the catering. We had a massive country roast with turkey, lamb, all the vegetables and more desserts than you could possibly believe. It was a fantastic night for young and old. We even started the night in the RSL, where we ate bully beef, which I can tell you is something you wouldn't believe, and curried eggs. That was to really take us back to 1945 to think about those wonderful young men who went to war on behalf of all of us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Over the last two decades in this country nine lives have been tragically lost to suicide every single day. Too many people are struggling with wait times, expensive appointments and ongoing stigma that prevents them from reaching out for support. It is critical that we take a decisive approach to preventing suicide. That's why I'm proud to be part of a government that is laser focused on addressing this issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government made a clear commitment at the last election to deliver 31 new and upgraded Medicare mental health centres across the nation. I fought for a centre in my electorate, and, with the tireless support of Assistant Minister Emma McBride, I'm proud to announce that the Redcliffe Medicare Mental Health Centre will be opening very soon. This centre will be free. It will be local, and it will be there when you need it most. Whether it's immediate help in a moment of distress, ongoing support for someone managing their mental health, guidance for carers and families, or connecting people to housing, employment and social supports, these centres are designed to make sure no-one falls through the cracks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every life lost is one too many. By providing a safe, accessible place for people in crisis, these centres give people the support they need when they need it most, and that can save lives. For too long, mental health care has been hard to access, expensive and stigmatised. I'm proud to be part of a government that is changing that for my community and for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  This government is failing Australians on housing. Rather than fixing what's holding builders back, the government abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, piled on hundreds of new laws and thousands of regulations and are standing by while their mates at the CFMEU drive up costs. This is a prime minister who swore there would be no new taxes, yet all he has delivered are new taxes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's latest idea is to come after your family home with a spare room tax. Instead of building more homes to fix the housing crisis, Labor wants to tax ones we already have—no new supply, no new solutions, just another desperate grab at your household. This thought bubble was thrown around at their three-day economic roundtable as a bid to fix the housing crisis, and now Labor have refused to rule it out. If you're a young family saving a spare bedroom for a future child, this government's coming after you. If you're a grandparent with spare rooms for the grandkids to visit, this government is coming after you. This is how far they've sunk—a government punishing Australians for their own failures and $43 billion wasted with fewer homes to show for it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They know they won't meet their housing targets, so they're coming after your household—a tax on the room your kids grew up in, a tax on the roof over your head or a tax on the home you worked for your lifetime to build. The government must rule out this shocking spare room tax.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  It's been four months since the election, and we have not wasted a single moment in delivering for Australians. We have been steadfastly focused on delivering for all Australians, including in my community of Maribyrnong. And, while we have been focused on delivering cheaper medicines and cutting 20 per cent off student debt, those opposite can't even pull themselves together. Instead, they're focused on some random, fanciful 'tax on your room'—it's insane. Their only apparent agenda seems to be coming from the member for New England and his determination to take Australia backwards by abandoning net zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It looks like the climate wars are there to stay in the coalition, but my community is taking advantage of 30 per cent cheaper batteries. Those opposite are divided. They're distracted. We're delivering for Australians. We've delivered the Commonwealth Prac Payment, supporting trainee nurses like those at Kangan Institute in Essendon. We've protected penalty rates while those opposite have tried to take them away. We're strengthening Medicare with more bulk-billing and cheaper medicines, while those opposite have spent the week barely hiding their hatred for bulk-billing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages are growing, unemployment and the gender pay gap are low, and interest rates have been cut for a third time this year. As I finish my first full month as the advocate for Maribyrnong in this place, the coalition would rather fight amongst themselves than fight for Australia. Labor is on the side of Maribyrnong. Labor is on the side of Australia. We've started as we mean to continue. We'll keep on delivering.</span>

My colleagues in the Senate have also struggled to receive a clear response as to whether or not this government will tax spare bedrooms. Labor has failed to get their own 1.2 million new homes program on track. They have failed to lower energy prices, as they promised more than 98 times. And they have failed to control migration. So I ask the government again today to officially rule out the spare bedroom tax. Tell Australians who have worked hard and are doing it tough that their spare bedrooms won't be taxed to fund this government's spending spree. You shouldn't have to pay for this government's mistakes. But this is always the problem with big-taxing, big-spending Labor governments: when they run out of money, they come after yours.</span>

Now, under the Albanese Labor government, we continue that tradition with the National Health Amendment (Cheaper Medicines) Bill 2025 passing the parliament this week.</span>

That's why, from 1 January 2026, no Australian will pay more than $25 for a general PBS script. That is a cut of more than 25 per cent, saving Australians over $200 million every single year. Medicines haven't cost $25 in Australia since 2004—the same year Shannon Noll topped the charts with his cover of 'What About Me?' Yes, it was a cover.</span>

For that little boy in the corner shop, for the last 12 months, Labor has delivered in Bean. We've delivered a Medicare mental health clinic in Tuggeranong, saved the Interchange Health general practice and Burrangiri, opened the tender for an urgent care clinic in Woden, and we'll be delivering a perinatal wellbeing centre in Tuggeranong. And now, from 1 January 2026, we'll be delivering cheaper medicines because we care about the cost of living and have always, always been the party of health care in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Australia faces the most dangerous strategic environment since the Second World War. Around the world, authoritarian regimes and leaders are flexing their muscles—whether it's Iran and its proxies in the Middle East, Russia with its illegal invasion of Ukraine, or the unprecedented military buildup of the Chinese Communist Party. History tells us that peace is only achieved through strength and deterrence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's deeply concerning that former Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is in China this week, celebrating a massive military parade that showcases the biggest expansion of Chinese Communist Party military capability in history, alongside authoritarian world leaders from Russia, North Korea and Iran—leaders who fundamentally reject the values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law. At the very moment when the Prime Minister should be strengthening our alliance with the United States, his former roommate Daniel Andrews is posing for a class photo alongside dictators and autocrats from around the world. We've heard nothing but silence from the Prime Minister on this. When will the Prime Minister stand up for Australians and call out Daniel Andrews? Even Annastacia Palaszczuk has said it is a bridge too far, alongside many other Labor luminaries. The first duty of every Australian government is to keep Australians safe. </span>
