                                    is
                                    going down. People are becoming poorer. If you go into shops,

                                    it's pie shops or hairdressers, it doesn't matter. It's hurting
                                    Australians. In a more pronounced way, it's hurting the poorest,
                                    because it's the poorest who need the power to keep themselves

                                    the price of power but also the price of groceries. It filters

                                    example—the government would underwrite the decommissioning and
                                    rehabilitation of the land at the time of obsolescence of wind
                                    towers and solar panels. They don't. Senator Murray Watt was
                                    very
                                    honest in his Senate committee when they said, 'Who's going to
                                    pay
                                    for this decommissioning?' and he said, 'That is an agreement
                                    that
                                    the farmer has to enter into with the proponent.' Andrew Dyer,
                                    who
                                    was the ombudsman appointed by Labor two years ago, said the
                                    cost of
                                    decommissioning one tower, if it's structurally sound, would be
                                    $600,000. If it's not structurally sound, it would be over $1½
                                    million dollars. The farmers won't have that money. They'll be
                                    sitting there.</span>
